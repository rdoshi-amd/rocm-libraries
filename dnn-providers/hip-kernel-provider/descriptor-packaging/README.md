# hkp_pack -- descriptor packaging

Build-time UKD/KMD/KDP -> kpack packaging. Provider-internal (`tools/hkp_pack.py`);
see `python/hkp_pack/` for the pipeline and `examples/descriptors/` for a real,
minimal authored source root.

## Source roots and what the walk accepts

Each wired root is walked recursively and packs into **its own** `OUT_ROOT`; no two
invocations share a destination and there is no shared stage tree. Each descriptor's
authored subpath is preserved verbatim into the staged and installed trees. Producer
selection is per-UKD on `kernel_source.kind`, never per-folder, so one root feeds every
producer into one kpack per arch. Nothing is registered in CMake: adding a descriptor is
dropping files in a folder.

The provider wires six roots: production, plus five over the four authored test sets
(`shared` packs twice, once into each test binary's discovery root).

| Root | Source | Ships |
|---|---|---|
| Production | `HIPKERNELPROVIDER_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_ROOT`, a `CACHE PATH` defaulting to the in-tree `src/engines/kernel_ingestor_engine/descriptors/` | yes |
| Test | `src/engines/kernel_ingestor_engine/test_descriptors/{shared,unit,integration,archive_fixture}/` | only under `HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ENABLE_TESTS` |

Production wiring is gated on the root holding at least one non-hidden `*.kdp.json`,
since a KDP is what arch pruning consumes. With none, packaging is **dormant** and any
stale product tree is removed; neither is an error. A root set but not a directory is
fatal. A KDP that prunes on every arch is a hard failure for a root the build NAMED, and
dormancy for the inherited default root.

Two rules govern the walk:

- **Hidden paths are skipped, and said so.** A dot-prefixed path segment or filename is
  warned and skipped, as is a `*.json` whose name carries no type token. The production
  content gate drops the same segments, so a KDP under a hidden path does not wire
  packaging. A type-tagged descriptor that is malformed, missing a field, of unknown
  type or carrying a dangling reference still fails.
- **An `embedded_source` `source_file` must act as an identity.** It is never
  normalised, so `..` is rejected (one file would take two identities) and an absolute
  path is rejected (the emitted key must be the same on every machine).

`embedded_source` is a **passthrough** kind: the descriptor is emitted as authored, no
producer runs, and it contributes no code object and no archive entry — the packer only
stamps the shard architecture and records provenance. A root of only passthrough kinds
therefore produces descriptors and **no** archive, and a shard with no compiled variant
holds no `kpack/`. Descriptors but no archive is legal; no descriptors never is.

## Compiler-bound specialization agreement

Packaging consumes UKD `provenance.specialization_contract` as data. It binds no
authoring profile and implements no second policy: there is no packaging `--profile`,
CMake `PROFILES` input or external root manifest. See the
[generator agreement reference](../../../projects/hipdnn/tools/IngestorGenerator/README.md#specialization-agreement)
for authoring and projection semantics.

**Declaration.** `schema_version: 1` plus `consumers`, each with `engine_id`, `kmd_id`,
`metadata_fields`, `matcher_only_fields`, `bindings` and `vocabulary`. The two field
lists exhaustively and disjointly partition the referenced KMD's fields. Binding keys
are exactly `metadata_fields`; each value is exactly `{field: "<attr>"}` or `{method:
"<accessor>"}`. IDs reference existing descriptors without copying KMD type/default
definitions. Shared standalone UKDs carry all consumers; duplicate or conflicting
declarations fail.

**Observations** use the selected compiler interpreter and the actual imported
builder/spec objects; `build_spec` hydrates ordinary defaults and default factories on
the object passed to `builder_fn`. Observe a declared direct field only when the builder
uses it without further resolution; otherwise observe the zero-argument bound effective
accessor the builder consumes, even when the raw field is non-null, because coupling may
override an explicit value (swizzle true with conflict-free V disabled). `None` is
authored intent, not a wildcard. Missing or noncallable accessors, unresolved `None`,
unsupported return types, exceptions and non-repeatable observations block full
agreement. Typing goes through the actual referenced KMD: BOOL stays boolean, a boolean
may intentionally project to 0/1 for INT, FLOAT normalizes numerically, and
descriptor-side type errors are not silently coerced. Observed effective values are
compared against each consumer's completed metadata before publication. Never guess
accessor conventions, copy policy formulas or reconstruct a different spec object for
comparison; matcher-only classification needs a source-use-site audit and independent
review.

**Shared compilation.** All consumers' observation requests are collected before a
shared variant is compiled, and every consumer is compared independently — including on
result reuse, so one successful consumer cannot certify a contradictory second. Reuse is
scoped to the packaging invocation, not a persistent cache.

**Reserved evidence.** Authored `provenance.spec` is preserved untouched; only the
producing compiler writes `provenance.effective_spec`, and an authored rocKE input
supplying a purported record is rejected. Extra/provenance passthrough must not
overwrite fresh observations during UKD rewriting or final publication, and packed-input
validation reads the actual packed record rather than recompiling authored input. The
schema-versioned producing-build record binds effective values and observation requests,
the canonical authored-input digest, observed builder/spec/accessor identities and
origins, consumer UKD/engine/KMD/KDP IDs, KDP/effective architecture and the actual
library/toc-key/symbol/payload SHA256. Each consumer's engine, KMD, KDP header, completed
metadata and declaration are bound by **content digest** rather than carried whole: the
checker rebuilds them from the descriptors in front of it. The binding digest excludes
the evidence itself, and the declaration stays alongside the record so a checker needs no
external profile.

Producer identities are module-qualified names and defining-file content hashes from the
actual imported objects. The defining path is watched for the invocation but never
published: shipping it would make the artifact a function of the building machine's
install layout. An unresolvable required origin fails evidence production, and producer
files must stay stable during the invocation. Wheel stamps are separately labeled build
provenance, not proof of imported origins.

**Full versus structural.** A full check validates the declaration and producing-build
record against current descriptors, schema, metadata, architecture and named payload
bytes; missing, unsupported, stale or mismatched required records fail. A valid packed
artifact can be fully checked **without rocKE installed on the verifying machine**. A
structural-only check passes the properties it checks but does not satisfy compiled
agreement, and mining/analysis profiles cannot supply or override compiler evidence.
Observations establish agreement with the builder's decisions and artifact integrity,
not equivalence of arbitrary machine code or correctness of native dispatch.

## Packed `kernel_source`

The runtime consumes packed per-architecture descriptors with source kind KPACK, not
unlowered rocKE/HIP authoring descriptors. A packed `kernel_source` carries **five
mandatory keys**:

```json
{
  "kind": "kpack",
  "library": "../../kpack/hip_kernel_provider_gfx942.kpack",
  "toc_key": "pointwise_add_f32",
  "symbol": "pointwise_add_f32",
  "sha256": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
  "signature": [
    {"kind": "global_buffer", "size": 8, "offset": 0},
    {"kind": "global_buffer", "size": 8, "offset": 8},
    {"kind": "by_value", "size": 4, "offset": 16}
  ]
}
```

`signature` is required: an empty array is legal and means a kernel taking no arguments,
so absence would be indistinguishable from it. Per entry `kind`, `size` and `offset` are
mandatory; `name` is optional, because clang emits argument names for some producers and
omits them for HIP `extern "C" __global__` kernels. `sha256` is shape-checked as 64
lowercase hex.

Neither digest nor signature is hand-authored, and they catch different drift. `sha256`
is byte identity of the **decompressed** code object, so a TOC entry pointing at the
wrong offset cannot silently hand back another entry's object; the loader rehashes before
`hipModuleLoadData` and raises `DIGEST_MISMATCH`. `kernel_signature.py` reads the
argument list back out of the compiled object — sniffing a clang offload bundle or a bare
ELF, and dropping compiler-appended `hidden_` arguments — catching a kernel whose
parameters changed while its bytes stayed internally consistent.

## Emitted-bundle census

Native proof executes typed provider registration/loading plus a finalized census;
source-text symbol matching is not certification. Registration is one call per packed
target, in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` beside `hkp_verify_embedded_sources()`:

```cmake
hkp_register_census_tests(
    TARGET hip_kernel_provider_tests
    PACK_NAME unit
    SUITES TestPointwisePacks
    EXPECTED_CASES
        EachPackShipsThreeKernelsCoveringTwoBlockSizesAndTwoDataTypes
        EveryKernelNamesItsPacksEmbeddedSource
        EveryEmbeddedSourceKeyResolvesInTheCompiledInTable
        EveryPackNamesTheArchitectureItWasPackedFor
        EveryPackSharesTheEngineDispatchAndAllButOneMatcher
        ExposesBlockSizeAsAKnobAndDtypeAsInternal
        MatchersCoverBothScopes
        SubtractsInTheRightDirection
)
```

`PACK_NAME` selects the wired pack target whose `OUT_ROOT` and recorded arch list the
entries address. Per declared suite and per arch in that list, CMake registers
`hip-kernel-provider-hkp-census-<arch>-<suite>`, invoking `hip_kernel_provider_tests
--gtest_filter=<suite>.*` directly, without Python, with
`HIPDNN_TEST_CENSUS_SUITE=<suite>`, `HIPDNN_TEST_EXPECTED_ARCH=<arch>` and
`HIPDNN_DESCRIPTOR_DIR=<OUT_ROOT>/<arch>` — its own shard, not a shared stage tree. Each
entry is an independent process labeled `unit_test;hip-kernel-provider;host`.

```bash
ctest --test-dir <build>/dnn-providers/hip-kernel-provider \
  --no-tests=error -V -R '^hip-kernel-provider-hkp-census-<arch>-<suite>$'
```

A suite is declarable only where it reads **exactly one** pack target's shard. The
authored dialect does not decide this: `TestPointwisePacks` is censused at `unit`
although that set is `embedded_source`, while `TestConvFwdPack` reads the `unit` and
`unit_shared` shards and is censused nowhere. One suite declared at two pack targets is
fatal: the entry name carries arch and suite alone, so the second registration would take
the first one's shard.

Strict mode is active only for a nonempty census-suite variable. Before default-root
setup it rejects missing/empty/nonexistent explicit roots and empty expected arches; the
production loader's normal fallback is unchanged. The named suite must exist and be
nonempty, and every registered case must complete and pass without skipping in each
iteration, with at least one completed iteration. Disabled, filtered-out, sharded-out,
failed or skipped cases, list-only and repeat-zero invocations cannot satisfy the census,
and repeated partial runs cannot accumulate coverage. `EXPECTED_CASES` supplies what
execution cannot: execution obligations are built from the cases the suite registered, so
a deleted case takes its own obligation with it.

The call is made where the target is defined and after it exists. A `PACK_NAME` no pack
target carries, an absent or nonexistent `TARGET`, and an empty recorded arch list are
each fatal rather than a silent drop, because a census that registers nothing is
indistinguishable from one that passed. A `PACK_NAME` the registry records as DORMANT is
the one absence that is not a mistake: it stages no shard, so the call registers nothing
and says so at STATUS, keeping a generated integration's declaration valid on every
configuration. Tests OFF and an empty `SUITES` register nothing. Neither structural nor
host loading proves numerical device behavior. The
[ingestor RUNBOOK](../../../projects/hipdnn/tools/ai/skills/hipdnn-ingestor-engine/RUNBOOK.md)
owns the complete create/extend sequence and post-regeneration gates.

## Build speed: put the comgr cache on local storage

Packing a rocKE descriptor set is dominated by lowering each kernel through
`libamd_comgr`, which caches results on disk. That cache defaults to **`~/.cache/comgr`**,
so on a network home directory every lookup is a network round trip and packing slows by
an order of magnitude. Point it somewhere local:

```bash
export AMD_COMGR_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/comgr-cache   # RAM disk or local disk
```

`AMD_COMGR_CACHE=0` disables caching outright, a diagnostic rather than a fix.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `HKP_PACK_JOBS` | Prewarm worker count. Defaults to `min(32, ncpu)`; `1` forces the serial path for a clean traceback. |

`HKP_PACK_JOBS` is read by a **direct child run** of `hkp_pack`. Inside the build the cap
is the `PACK_JOBS <n>` argument at the `hkp_wire_pack_target()` call site, which the
wiring transports to the tool. It is per call site because roots carry no ordering edge,
so the generator runs them at once and unbounded pools multiply. All six calls name a
value: `1` for the small roots, `2` for the `integration` test root and the production
target. Omitting `PACK_JOBS` lets the packer size itself against the machine.

## Running the tests

```bash
cd dnn-providers/hip-kernel-provider
PYTHONPATH=descriptor-packaging/python:rocke/library:rocke/platform/python:/opt/rocm-kpack/python \
    python3 -m pytest descriptor-packaging/tests -q
```

`rocm_kpack` (the third `PYTHONPATH` entry, or `--kpack-python-dir` /
`HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ROCM_KPACK_DIR`) is the kpack archive reader/writer most of the suite
round-trips through. Its absence is diagnosed once by the `rocm_kpack_dir` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py`: every test needing it skips with one message naming the dependency.
Set `HIPKERNELPROVIDER_KPACK_REQUIRE_ROCM_KPACK=1` (mirroring `_REQUIRE_HIPCC` /
`_REQUIRE_COMGR`) to turn that skip into a hard failure, e.g. in CI.

`-m quick` selects the load-time/pure-unit subset needing neither `hipcc` nor
`rocm_kpack`/comgr.

### Desk-check a variant set (`hkp_pack.desk_check`, `tools/hkp_desk_check.py`)

```
tools/hkp_desk_check.py --mode {full,structural} [--kpack-python-dir D]
                        [--field F] [--drift-field F] <path/to/*.kdp.json>
```

The desk check resolves KDP engine → UED metadata → KMD UUID within the selected
descriptor tree/shards, completing defaults and canonicalizing metadata through that
schema. Tuple identity is engine-wide, including cross-pack overlap in effective
architectures: equal metadata on disjoint architectures is legal, conflicting overlapping
candidates are not. A KDP filename is not a KMD reference. An authored tree without
compiler evidence can receive only a structural result.

`--mode` is required and has no default, because a default would let a structural run
read as a full one. Every run prints a leading `mode=<full|structural>` line and a
`compiled specialization agreement:` line.

- `--mode structural` accepts an authored (pre-pack) or shipped file and reports
  agreement as NOT CHECKED.
- `--mode full` is for a shipped shard. It binds each kernel whose declaration names
  specialized metadata fields to the producing build's record and the archive bytes the
  descriptor names, reporting `OK for N kernel(s)`. A missing, unsupported or mismatched
  record for such a kernel is a failure, never a successful COULD-NOT-CHECK. A kernel
  declaring no specialized metadata field is listed by name under `compiled
  specialization NO COMPILED CLAIM:`, printed alongside `OK for N kernel(s)` in a mixed
  KDP. Only when NO kernel makes a claim does the agreement line itself read `NO
  COMPILED CLAIM`.

The **matcher field list** resolves in a fixed precedence: an explicit `--field` outranks
everything; otherwise, when the bundle declares a `specialization_contract`, **both
halves of its partition are the field list**, since a matcher-only field is one the
matcher still compares; failing that, the fields the descriptors carry.

The metadata/spec **drift** list (`--drift-field`, invariant 1) resolves separately and
inherits none of that: absent an explicit `--drift-field` it is every field carrying both
a spec value and a metadata value, the widest comparison the data admits. The declared
contract is an input to invariant 1, not a bound on it, since confining the audit to the
contract's fields would exit 0 on drift in a third. `--drift-field` narrows it explicitly,
and in the log, for a field whose two sides speak deliberately different vocabularies.

`tests/test_desk_check_invariants.py` exercises the shipped module. Keep structural
identity, real packed observations and tampered-evidence checks distinct from native
registration and numerical tests.

### Embedded-source verification (`tools/hkp_verify_embedded_sources.py`)

A staged tree holds descriptor JSON only, so an `embedded_source` descriptor resolves its
`source_file` against a key table the build compiles into the binary, and nothing in the
staged tree proves that table holds the named source. This step reads that table and
every `embedded_source` descriptor under the staged roots the binary serves, comparing
**presence** (each named `source_file` is a key) and **location** (the file registered
under that key is the one at the authored location the descriptor's provenance records,
joining the `provenance.source_label` root with `rel_dir` and `source_file`).
`--pack-stamp` adds a rule: a pack root whose stamp is present holds at least one
descriptor. A root whose pack is not wired — the dormant production root — contributes no
stamp and is not checked. It runs over emitted JSON alone and imports no part of the
packer.

**The comparison runs one way, staged descriptor → table, so a pass is not evidence that
a bundle is reachable.** A key no descriptor names is not an error: most embedded kernels
have no descriptor at all. Nor is a descriptor that never reaches a staged root —
authored under a folder no pack is wired to, it is never staged, so this walk never sees
it while the runtime never receives it. Catching that needs the authored tree as a second
input, which provenance cannot supply, because the packer is what writes provenance. The
check to state is *does a shard appear under that pack target's `OUT_ROOT`*, not *did the
verifier pass*. An absent root, an empty root, a root with no `embedded_source`
descriptor and an absent key table each pass — which is why a pass reports the two counts
it compared.

### Real-corpus builder-signature guards (`tests/test_hkp_pack_rocke.py`)

The real gfx942 `build_*` functions in `rocke/library/kernels/gfx942/` must satisfy
`_require_spec_arch_signature`'s `(spec, *, arch)` contract. The real-builder cases in
`tests/test_hkp_pack_rocke.py` and the rejection cases in
`tests/test_hkp_pack_producer_guards.py` cover complementary paths. Signature acceptance
alone is not effective-specialization or numerical proof.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=descriptor-packaging/python:rocke/library:rocke/platform/python:/opt/rocm-kpack/python \
    python3 -m pytest descriptor-packaging/tests/test_hkp_pack_rocke.py \
        descriptor-packaging/tests/test_hkp_pack_producer_guards.py -q
```
