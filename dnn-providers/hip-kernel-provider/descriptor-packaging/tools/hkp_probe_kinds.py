"""The producer kinds a packaging probe supports: one entry per kernel_source.kind.

Shared by hkp_probe_derive_root.py (compile-group selection, expect.json) and
hkp_probe_assert.py (per-UKD checks). A kind with no entry is rejected by derive at
configure time and fails `no-rules-for-kind` in the assertion, so a new producer cannot
pass a probe without being described here.

Each entry also names the packed OUTPUT TYPE of the kind:
    kpack        the packer compiles/packs the UKD into the kpack archive and ships a
                 `kind: kpack` UKD (hip, rocke, hsaco)
    passthrough  the packer ships the UKD as authored; nothing enters the archive
                 (embedded_source)
A new kind whose output is one of these, with provenance checks that already exist by
name, is one entry in KINDS plus one end-to-end test case. A kind needing a new
provenance check adds it to hkp_probe_assert._PROVENANCE_CHECKS; a new output type adds
its check set to hkp_probe_assert._OUTPUT_CHECKS; a kind the packer does not support
needs packer work first. A UKD of an unregistered kind in a KDP that ships for a probed
arch makes configure fail; it must live in a KDP that does not ship for a probed arch,
or the probe needs a decision.
