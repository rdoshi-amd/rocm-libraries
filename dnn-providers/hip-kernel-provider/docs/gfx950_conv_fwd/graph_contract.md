# gfx950 forward convolution graph contract

Integration base: `9285929e1de2ada46cc01e9054ff3ed5fa6c0456`.
Engine: `hipkernel:Gfx950ConvFwd`. Descriptor dialect: `packaged`.

## 1. Operation match

Exactly one `ConvolutionFwdAttributes` node implements plain 2D forward
cross-correlation. The node binds three distinct tensor UIDs: input X, filter W,
and output Y. Bias, activation, backward, and other fused graphs decline.
The operation uses FP32 accumulation and uniform FP16 or BF16 input, filter,
and output. There is no workspace.

## 2. Field audit

The authority is `flatbuffers_sdk/schemas/convolution_fwd_attributes.fbs`.

| Field | Treatment |
|---|---|
| `x_tensor_uid` | Bind a nonvirtual, dense, rank-4 input tensor. |
| `w_tensor_uid` | Bind a nonvirtual, dense, rank-4 filter `[K, C/groups, Y, X]`; W dimension 1 must divide X's channels, and the quotient is the group count, which must also divide K. |
| `y_tensor_uid` | Bind output; validate its inferred dimensions and layout during prepare. |
| `pre_padding` | Require two nonnegative integers; match both compiled values. |
| `post_padding` | Require equality with pre-padding on both axes. |
| `stride` | Require two positive integers; match both compiled values. |
| `dilation` | Require two positive integers; match both compiled values. |
| `conv_mode` | Require `CROSS_CORRELATION`; decline `CONVOLUTION` and `UNSET`. |

The enclosing node's compute type must be `FLOAT`. Tensors must have positive
extents and valid physical strides. Reject virtual tensors, constant values,
runtime pass-by-value, ragged offsets, incompatible dtypes, and overlapping
runtime buffers. Actual addresses must satisfy the builder's 16-byte alignment
contract. Dense byte counts and kernel index arithmetic must fit signed 32-bit
values. Tensor names and graph names do not affect computation.

The enclosing graph's `is_override_shape_enabled` field (from `graph.fbs`)
must be false. Each packaged kernel has fixed dimensions and strides, so the
matcher rejects graphs that enable execution-time shape overrides.

This schema has no alpha/beta, bias, or group-count scalar. Plain convolution
overwrites Y. Groups are inferred as X channels divided by W dimension 1; X
channels and K must both be divisible by the group count, which is at most
65535 because the group rides on grid z. Depthwise (`C/groups == 1`) and
channel-multiplier depthwise (`K/groups > 1`) are ordinary grouped cases.
Grouped pointwise convolution -- groups > 1 with a 1x1 filter, stride 1 and no
padding -- is accepted. rocKE's flat pointwise path indexes the input and
output as one GEMM and does not select the group's channel slabs, so no kernel
is built for it; grouped kernels built against a non-pointwise problem serve it
through their coordinate transforms (section 7). Fusions are
graph compositions and are rejected through the single-node requirement.

## 3. Frontend and reference reading

`ConvFpropAttributes` defaults to cross-correlation. `set_padding` sets both
padding vectors; separate pre/post setters can express asymmetric padding,
which this engine declines. Logical dimensions remain NCHW even when storage
is channels-last. The GPU reference `GpuRefConvFwd.cpp` indexes logical NCHW
using supplied strides and computes cross-correlation without reversing W.
The equivalent framework operation is `torch.nn.functional.conv2d` with no
bias, `groups` equal to the inferred group count, and explicit stride, padding,
and dilation. The CPU and GPU references infer the group count the same way.

No deprecated convolution attribute spelling appears in the pinned schema.
The output is inferred by the frontend and need not be complete during graph
matching, so output layout validation belongs to dispatch preparation.

## 4. Real graph sources

The in-tree convolution bundles and published hipDNN graph JSON carry logical
NCHW tensor dimensions and explicit strides. Both sources include
layouts and operations outside this engine's contract; layout must be derived
from strides, never from a tensor name or the dimensions alone. Published
workloads are substantially broader than the smoke shape and include backward,
3D, and fused graphs, which this engine declines, and grouped graphs, which it
serves when a matching catalog entry exists.

The convolution miner retains each source graph, its attributes, and its
provenance. Coverage is assessed against that inventory, independently of the
small correctness matrix. A legal rocKE request without a compiled catalog
entry is reported as a catalog gap.

## 5. Mapping to the compiled kernel

| rocKE field | hipDNN source / rule |
|---|---|
| `N` | X dimension 0; Y dimension 0 must agree. |
| `C` | X dimension 1; W dimension 1 is `C/groups`. |
| `K` | W dimension 0; Y dimension 1 must agree. |
| `Hi`, `Wi` | X dimensions 2 and 3. |
| `Y`, `X` | W dimensions 2 and 3 (filter height and width). |
| `sH`, `sW` | `stride[0]`, `stride[1]`. |
| `pH`, `pW` | `pre_padding[0]`, `pre_padding[1]`, equal to post-padding. |
| `dH`, `dW` | `dilation[0]`, `dilation[1]`. |
| `Ho`, `Wo` | `(input + 2*padding - dilation*(filter-1) - 1)/stride + 1`, with nonnegative numerator. |
| `dtype` | `HALF` maps to `fp16`; `BFLOAT16` maps to `bf16`. |
| `layout` | Dense channels-last. |
| `groups` | X dimension 1 divided by W dimension 1; must divide both C and K; at most 65535. |
| `tile_m`, `tile_n`, `tile_k` | Compiled KMD fields; `tile_k` is an exposed engine knob (as is `kernel_family`, below). Direct kernels carry `tile_k=0`, so on a graph the direct family serves the knob also advertises 0, which forces the direct family (a known quirk; prefer `kernel_family`). |
| `warp_m`, `warp_n`, `warp_tile_m`, `warp_tile_n`, `warp_tile_k`, `wave_size` | Resolved compile-time tuning, checked by the builder and native geometry. |
| `pipeline`, `epilogue` | Dispatcher-resolved and carried in metadata. The catalog ships `mem`; the native matcher also admits `compv3`, `compv4` and `basic`, which share its launch. rocKE builds the `default` epilogue only with scalar stores, so its descriptor must carry an odd build `K/groups`; it then serves any graph's `K/groups`. |
| `kernel_family` | `0` implicit GEMM (KMD default), `1` direct depthwise; also an integer engine knob. Any other value is refused. |
| `direct_variant`, `block_w`, `block_waves` | `none`, 0, 0 (KMD defaults) for implicit GEMM; for direct kernels see section 6. |

Physical layouts (strides in elements):

| Tensor | Logical dimensions | Strides | rocKE physical order |
|---|---|---|---|
| X | `[N,C,Hi,Wi]` | `[Hi*Wi*C,1,Wi*C,C]` | NHWC |
| W | `[K,C/G,Y,X]` | `[Y*X*C/G,1,X*C/G,C/G]` | KYXC per group |
| Y | `[N,K,Ho,Wo]` | `[Ho*Wo*K,1,Wo*K,K]` | NHWK |

`G` is the group count. Group `g` reads input channels `[g*C/G, (g+1)*C/G)`
and writes output channels `[g*K/G, (g+1)*K/G)`.

A unit-extent axis does not participate in address arithmetic, so its declared
stride need not equal the canonical value. All nondegenerate axes must match.

## 6. Direct depthwise family

Kernels with `kernel_family=1` are rocKE's direct depthwise kernels from
`kernels/common/conv_direct_grouped.py`. Their implicit-GEMM fields hold
placeholders that the matcher requires exactly: `tile_m`, `tile_n`, `tile_k`,
`warp_m`, `warp_n` and the three `warp_tile_*` fields are 0, `wave_size` is 64,
and `pipeline` and `epilogue` are `none`. An implicit-GEMM kernel must carry
`direct_variant=none` and `block_w=block_waves=0`. Both the Python adapter and
the native matcher enforce these rules and the guard below.

| `direct_variant` | rocKE spec | `block_w` | `block_waves` | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `std` | `DirectDepthwiseSpec` | Output columns per workgroup, positive | 1 to 16 | Any |
| `spatial` | `DirectDepthwiseSpatialSpec` | 0; the kernel uses `block_waves * (64 / groups)` | 1 to 16 | Fewer than 64 |

A graph is served by the direct family only when all of these hold; otherwise
only implicit-GEMM kernels match it:

- pure depthwise: `groups == C == K` (W dimension 1 is 1 and there is no
  channel multiplier);
- `stride[0] == stride[1]`, `pre_padding[0] == pre_padding[1]` (padding is
  already symmetric), and dilation 1 on both axes;
- odd filter extents and "same" padding `pad == (Y - 1) / 2`, which rocKE's
  own direct validators require;
- row and column coverage: `floor((Hi - 1) / stride) == Ho - 1`, and the same
  for `Wi` and `Wo`. rocKE's direct kernels emit output row `p / stride` as
  they stream input row `p` (for `p` divisible by the stride), so other
  paddings leave output rows unproduced or write past the last output row into
  the next image;
- grid axes at most 65535, including grid z, which is N.

Launch geometry, block `(64 * block_waves, 1, 1)`, no LDS and no workspace:

| Variant | Grid |
|---|---|
| `std` | `(ceil(Wo / block_w), ceil(groups / (64 * block_waves)), N)` |
| `spatial` | `(ceil(Wo / (block_waves * (64 / groups))), 1, N)` |

The tensor storage, argument list and byte counts are the same as for implicit
GEMM (section 5).

## 7. Which kernels serve a graph

rocKE's AOT kernels (rocm-libraries #12783) take the problem as kernel
arguments, so a packaged kernel is not limited to the shape it was compiled
for. Its descriptor metadata still records that build problem (`N` through
`dW`, `groups`), because the build problem decides the few things the binary
keeps. A kernel serves a graph when the graph's dtype is the kernel's and the
graph fits these capabilities (`gfx950_conv_fwd_capabilities` and
`gfx950_conv_fwd_serves` in the adapter; `conv::implicitGemmCapabilities`,
`conv::implicitGemmServes` and `conv::directServes` in the native pack):

| Family | Compiled in, from the build problem | Requirement on the graph |
|---|---|---|
| Implicit GEMM | Grouped code path when build `groups > 1` | An ungrouped binary serves only `groups == 1`; a grouped one serves both. |
| Implicit GEMM | Pointwise GEMM when the build problem is 1x1, stride 1, unpadded | A pointwise binary serves only pointwise graphs; any other binary serves them through its descriptors. |
| Implicit GEMM | Load width: the widest of 8, 4, 2, 1 dividing the build `C/groups`, capped by the tile | Divides the graph's `C/groups`. |
| Implicit GEMM | `cshuffle` store width: the widest of 8, 4, 2, 1 dividing the build `K/groups` (`default` stores scalars) | Divides the graph's `K/groups`. |
| Direct depthwise | Filter, stride, padding (and dilation 1) | Equal to the graph's; the graph also passes the section 6 guard. |
| Direct `spatial` | Also the group count (`64 / groups` columns per wave) | Equal to the graph's. |

Batch, image size, channel counts, filter, stride, padding and dilation of an
implicit-GEMM graph are all runtime values, as are batch, image size and the
group count of a direct `std` graph. Every kernel then also needs a grid of at
most 65535 per axis and, for implicit GEMM, a reduction `Y*X*C/groups` below
2^23 for the kernel's 24-bit address products.

`library/tests/test_convolution_forward_packaging.py` checks that the packaged
binary is the IR rocKE emits for other problems with the same capabilities,
and that the implicit-GEMM rule is the forward subset of rocKE's
`KernelCache.supports_problem`. The GPU integration suite runs every serving
kernel, all compiled for other shapes, on graphs no kernel was compiled for.

Without benchmarking or a recorded winner, the engine serves the direct
default arm, then the dispatcher's implicit-GEMM tile; among kernels at the
same level it prefers the kernel compiled for this graph (rocKE's dispatcher
pick for it), then the pointwise and ungrouped code paths the graph can use,
then wider load and store widths. Benchmarking measures every serving kernel.
