"""Generate (or verify) the authored descriptors for one arch's FlyDSL kernels.

Usage:
    python gen_descriptors.py --arch gfx11-generic
    python gen_descriptors.py --arch gfx11-generic --check     # verify, write nothing

**Generated, not hand-written, and checked in.** Every field is derived from
``<content>/<op>/<arch>/manifest.json`` and the code objects it names, so a
descriptor cannot disagree with the object it describes. ``<content>`` is
FlyDSL's producer folder under the provider's production descriptor root
(``generators._flydsl_env.CONTENT_DIR``), the same root rocKE's bundles are
authored in.

**We author the input form; the shared packer produces the shipped form.** Each
UKD is ``kind: "hsaco"`` and names its object, which sits beside it, by file
name. At build time the packer that packs every other bundle in the root
resolves the object, packs it into the per-arch
``hip_kernel_provider_<arch>.kpack``, reads the argument signature out of the
object, and rewrites the UKD to ``kind: "kpack"``. So the archive path, TOC key
and signature are deliberately *not* written here: the packer derives all three
from the object and is the single place they are computed, for FlyDSL as for
every other producer.

**The packer checks neither an object's bytes nor its target processor**; it
packs what a UKD names into every shard the UKD's ``arch`` lists. Both checks
live here instead, and ``--check`` runs before every pack: each object must hash
to its manifest's SHA256, its ``amdhsa.target`` must be the arch its directory
names, and for a generic target its ELF ``e_flags`` must carry that generic
machine.

**Generic targets.** ``<arch>`` may be an LLVM generic target
(``gfx11-generic``): one object set that runs on every member of the family
(``generators/arch_families.json``). Its KDP and UKDs then list every member in
``arch``, so the packer copies the same bytes into each member's own shard and
each device finds them under its own ``gcnArchName`` -- no runtime support for
generic names is needed.

Layout, per op:

* ``<content>/<op>/`` -- the descriptors shared by every arch: metadata schema,
  engine, heuristic, dispatch and the kernel-scoped matcher. One copy, so the
  authored root holds each id once.
* ``<content>/<op>/<arch>/`` -- that arch's pack (KDP), one UKD per object, and
  the objects themselves with ``manifest.json`` and ``SOURCE.md``.

``--check`` re-derives the documents and compares them to what is checked in,
then runs the packer's own authoring validator over the whole FlyDSL folder.
