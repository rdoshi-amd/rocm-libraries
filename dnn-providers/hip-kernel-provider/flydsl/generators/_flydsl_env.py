"""Pinned build environment for the FlyDSL AOT generators.

Every generator in this directory compiles against *one* declared toolchain: a
pinned FlyDSL wheel, the vendored kernel sources under ``kernels_src/``, and a
recorded ROCm version. All three go into the per-arch ``SOURCE.md``, because a
checked-in code object regenerated against a different toolchain is a change
that reviews as a no-op diff. The FlyDSL release notes and this tree's Flash2
precedent both record ~1.4x swings from the ROCm version alone on identical
source.

The environment is deliberately process-wide and single-arch. FlyDSL reads
``ARCH`` from ``os.environ`` at each compile (``flydsl/utils/env.py``:
``CompileEnvManager.arch``), so mutating it mid-run would work -- and would make
the arch a kernel object was *built* for independent of the arch its filename
claims. That is the exact mislabeling hazard the Flash2 CMake block warns about,
so one arch per invocation is enforced here and the generator additionally
checks each object's own ``amdhsa.target`` after the fact.
