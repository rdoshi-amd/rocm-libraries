"""Provenance records for the checked-in code objects of one op and one arch.

Two artifacts, written by every generator run:

* ``<content>/<op>/<arch>/manifest.json`` -- the machine-readable record, beside
  the objects: the toolchain the objects were built with, a digest of the
  generator inputs, and one row per instance (knobs, priority, symbol, kernarg
  layout, SHA256). The descriptor generator reads it; nothing else is a source
  of truth for what an object is. It lives in DVC with the objects.
* ``<content>/<op>/<arch>.SOURCE.md`` -- the human-readable view of the same
  record, beside the DVC pointer for ``<arch>/`` and kept in git, following the
  convention ``src/engines/asm_sdpa_engine/asm/asm_kernels/`` established for
  checked-in ``.co``: upstream source, toolchain, and a full SHA256 manifest.
  It is how a change to objects that live in DVC shows up in a review.

A binary is only reviewable through these files, so a *stale* one is worse than
a missing one. ``refresh_source_md`` therefore rebuilds the document from the
manifest on every run rather than patching it.
