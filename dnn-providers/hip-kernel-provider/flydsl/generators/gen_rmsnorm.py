"""Compile the checked-in RMSNorm code objects for one architecture.

    python -m generators.gen_rmsnorm --arch gfx1151

Writes ``<content>/rmsnorm/<arch>/<instance>.hsaco`` for every row of
``_instances.rmsnorm_instances()``, plus the ``manifest.json`` and
``SOURCE.md`` beside them. ``<content>`` is FlyDSL's bundle folder under the
provider's production descriptor root (``_flydsl_env.CONTENT_DIR``).

Compilation needs no matching GPU. Under ``COMPILE_ONLY=1`` the launcher traces
and lowers but never dispatches, so a gfx942 object builds on an RDNA laptop --
which is what makes the CDNA work in ``PORTING.md`` a *validation* handoff
rather than a generation one.

**Every object is verified against its own AMDGPU metadata before it is
written.** The increment-1 gate established that FlyDSL emits no argument
*names* in that note (HIP ``extern "C"`` kernels do not; the AITER ASM objects
do), so ``requireSignatureMatch`` at load time can catch a kind/size/offset
change but cannot catch an operand *permutation* -- two pointers of the same
size swapped look identical to it. The compensation is here, at the point where
we still know what we asked for: assert the full ``(kind, size, offset)``
sequence against the layout recorded below, and carry the semantic names
forward into the descriptor metadata so the permutation question is answerable
by reading the manifest. Emitting ``.name`` from FlyDSL is the real fix and is
upstream's to make; this keeps it off the critical path.
