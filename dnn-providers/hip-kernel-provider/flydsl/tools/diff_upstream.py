"""Diff the vendored FlyDSL kernel sources against an upstream checkout.

    python tools/diff_upstream.py --upstream /path/to/FlyDSL

``kernels_src/`` is a vendored copy of a few FlyDSL kernel modules carrying
deliberate local modifications, each recorded in the copied file's own header.
This tool answers the question those headers cannot: *has anything else moved?*
-- either a local edit nobody wrote down, or an upstream re-vendor that did not
update the pins in ``generators/_flydsl_env.py``.

**Both sides are normalized with black before diffing, and that is a
requirement rather than a nicety.** The repo's pre-commit hook reformats our
copy (``.pre-commit-config.yaml``: ``psf/black`` 25.12.0, and hipDNN is opted
*in*), so an un-normalized diff reports a whole-file delta on every vendored
file and buries the real semantic drift inside it. A tool that produces that
output would be worse than no tool: it reads as "everything changed" and gets
ignored. If black is unavailable we refuse rather than emit it.

Normalization is symmetric, so the exact formatting settings do not matter to
the result -- only that both sides receive the same ones. No black config
applies to this tree, so the defaults are what the hook uses.

**A file showing a diff is the expected output, not a failure.** The vendored
copy carries deliberate modifications -- recorded in its own header -- so it
differs from upstream by construction, and the provenance header itself always
shows as an addition. This tool is a review aid: it shows you what to read, and
you decide whether each hunk is one of the recorded modifications or something
nobody wrote down. Exit status therefore reports whether the *comparison* held
together, not whether files matched: 0 when every vendored file was compared
against a real upstream counterpart, 1 when one had none (wrong checkout, or a
file that moved upstream), and 2 when the comparison could not be run at all.
