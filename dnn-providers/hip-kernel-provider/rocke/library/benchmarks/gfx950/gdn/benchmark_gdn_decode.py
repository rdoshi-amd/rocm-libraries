"""Benchmark scenario for the GDN single-token decode kernel.

Sweeps the decode batch range and reports per-launch time for the
configuration the dispatcher actually selects, so the numbers describe what
production would run rather than one fixed tile. Because the tuned tile varies
with batch, the selected tile is printed alongside each row.

Every scenario is correctness-gated first: a timing number from a numerically
wrong kernel is worse than no number at all, so a shape that fails the gate is
reported as such and excluded rather than timed.

Two timings are reported per shape because they answer different questions:

``eager``   one launch per synchronisation, i.e. what a decode loop that
            dispatches from Python actually pays. Includes host launch cost.
``device``  a captured HIP graph replayed, dividing out the per-launch host
            cost, i.e. what the GPU itself spends.

Decode at small batch is launch-bound, so ``eager`` and ``device`` measure
different things; reporting only one of them mis-states where the time goes.
