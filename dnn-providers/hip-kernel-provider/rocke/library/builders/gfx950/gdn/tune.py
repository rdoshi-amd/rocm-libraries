"""Re-measure the GDN decode tuning table.

The per-batch tile table in ``dispatch/gdn/gfx950.py`` is an empirical claim,
so the measurement that produced it lives here rather than outside the tree:
anyone can re-run it, challenge a band, or re-tune after a kernel change.

Device time is the metric. Host launch cost is identical across tiles and, at
small batch, larger than the kernel itself, so wall time would mask exactly the
differences the table is choosing between.

Every configuration is correctness-gated before it is timed. The reference
depends only on the batch, not the tile, so it is computed once per batch and
reused across the whole configuration space.
