"""Attention / FMHA dispatcher family (path-level selection).

Worked implementation mirroring :mod:`rocke.dispatch.gemm.bf16_rcr`, backed by
:mod:`kernels.common.attention_unified` (the unified tiled FMHA emitter).

This module owns only the assembly: the registry, the entry points, and the
re-exports that make ``dispatch.attention`` one import for callers. What each
candidate *is* lives in the arch module that owns it. See :mod:`.common` for
the scope of the dispatch decision and what it deliberately defers.

Registration is explicit rather than an import side effect, so the registry
contents are a readable list, a test can assemble a registry from a subset of
arch modules, and adding an arch touches exactly one line here.

    Returns a ``{canonical_arch: DispatchResult}`` mapping so the caller can
    compare selections across architectures from a single host.

    .. note:: **The arch is taken from the request, never from the device** --
       that part is unconditional. One host read remains: with ``req.num_cus ==
       0`` the CU count is auto-resolved, and on a box whose arch matches the
       target arch that resolution reads the live device (see
       :func:`~.common._resolve_num_cus`). Since ``num_cus`` drives 2D/3D routing
       and ``num_segments``, the same ``(req, arch)`` pair can select a different
       kernel on a gfx942 box, a gfx950 box, and a CPU box. **Pass an explicit
       ``num_cus`` (or ``target_ctas``) to make the comparison reproducible and
       fully host-independent.**

    Example::

        results = dispatch_for_arches(req, ["gfx942", "gfx950"])
        print(results["gfx942"].candidate.name)
        print(results["gfx950"].candidate.name)

    Each arch is canonicalized via :func:`canonical_arch` (strips suffixes such
    as ``:sramecc+``, normalizes case) before dispatch, so ``"GFX950"`` and
    ``"gfx950:sramecc+"`` both appear in the output under the key ``"gfx950"``.
    Duplicate arches after canonicalization are dispatched only once, and
    insertion order is preserved so the output reads in the caller's order.

    Args:
        req:    Base :class:`AttentionRequest`. Its ``arch`` field is overridden
                for each target; all other fields are preserved.
        arches: A sequence of arch names (``["gfx942", "gfx950"]``) or, for CLI
                and config callers, one comma-separated string
                (``"gfx942,gfx950"``). Splitting happens only for the ``str``
                form -- a sequence is used as given, so an arch name is never
                silently cut in half.
        ranker: Optional ranker forwarded to :func:`dispatch_attention`.
        strict: ``True`` (default) propagates the first dispatch failure.
                ``False`` maps each failing arch to its exception instead, so
                one unsupported arch does not discard the results for the
                others -- the point of a cross-arch comparison. Values are then
