"""gfx950 candidate and tuned tile selection for GDN decode.

This module owns the two arch-specific decisions: what the chip can serve
(``Capability`` plus the residual predicate, which ends in the kernel's own
``is_valid_spec``) and how a request is turned into a concrete spec.

The tile selection is the interesting part. ``blocks_per_v_dim`` splits each
value head's V dimension across several workgroups purely to manufacture
parallelism; it costs redundant work per split. At small batch there are too
few sequences to fill the machine, so paying that cost buys occupancy. As the
batch grows the launch already has ample parallelism and the split becomes
overhead, so the tuned tile collapses to one workgroup per head and instead
widens the workgroup. That trend, not any individual measurement, is what this
table encodes.

# measured; the band edges between them are interpolation, chosen to place each
# anchor comfortably inside its own band rather than at a boundary.
