# Tiled decode KV loading

The gfx942 and gfx950 segment kernels distinguish cache page size `P` from
compute tile size `T`. Both consume logical token tiles and stage the existing
`[T,D]` K/V LDS operands. Transfer width and split-KV segment length remain
separate target and scheduling choices. Staging is one compute tile per buffer;
MFMA, online softmax, synchronization and the reducer are unchanged.
For gfx942 D256/T32, V uses one tile buffer to fit the LDS budget. V has no
next-tile prefetch; the existing loop-entry wait/barrier completes prior PV
reads before the same buffer is written again. This intentionally changes
emission for a configuration that previously exceeded the target LDS limit.

- Strided KV uses independent K/V byte strides.
- Existing paged configurations retain their descriptor loader: `T == P` on
  both targets, and `T < P` on gfx942.
- The token-mapped loader supports `T=32` with `P=1,16` on both targets, and
  `P=64` on gfx950. It resolves each logical token through the shared K/V page
  table. Different lanes can reference nonadjacent physical pages.

`tile_size_override` now applies to both targets. With no override, existing
page sizes keep their previous behavior; page size 1 defaults to tile size 32.
Non-page-sized tiles append `_t<T>` to the central kernel name, including
previously unnamed gfx942 half-page variants. This fixes artifact collisions;
existing full-page names and emitted code are unchanged. The installed C spec
layout and builder signatures are unchanged.

## Admission and addressing

The initial token-mapped path admits fp16/bf16, D64/128/256, one query per
sequence, GQA ratios dividing 16, and optional sliding windows. It uses
pool-wide buffer descriptors with 64-bit base pointers and bounded i32 byte
offsets. Both contiguous `[physical_pages,P,Hkv,D]` pools must fit in
`0x7fff0000` bytes. Larger pools are rejected before cache lookup or launch;
this path does not offer a wide-address fallback or FP8 dequantization.
Sequence rounding and segment-workspace offsets are also bounded. Explicit
launches use 1..128 segments; direct default admission conservatively budgets
workspace for the policy ceiling of 128 segments.

For each cooperative transfer, the loader computes the logical token from
`tile*T + linear/D`, then derives the page-table index and within-page row
using division and remainder by `P`. Invalid speculative tokens select logical
token zero **before** looking up a page. Separately, their data offset selects
an out-of-bounds buffer offset, making the transfer supply zeros to LDS. Thus
the table guard does not depend on the data-load mask.

The preserved page-contained loaders require finite values in unused rows of
a physical page: their PV computation can multiply masked zero probabilities
by those values. The new token-mapped loader also supports NaN padding because
it zeros invalid data loads before PV. This change does not fix that inherited
page-contained limitation.

The runtime checks shapes, dtypes, contiguity, alignment, actual pool bounds,
table capacity, matching architecture, and explicit segment/reducer semantics.
It never reads device metadata to the host. Callers own the values: lengths
are in `[0,max_seqlen_k]`, query offsets are `[0,1,...,B]`, and referenced page
IDs index the physical pools. Inactive table entries need not be initialized.
The C builders share this caller contract; metadata cannot be validated during
source generation. `allow_unsupported` does not bypass runtime safety checks.

Explicit gfx942/gfx950 paged 3D specs must expose valid page/tile geometry and
a boolean `uses_paged_gather` that agrees with it: `T > P` on gfx942, `T != P`
on gfx950. The effective tile must agree with `tile_size_override`, including
the default tile when no override is set. Address-width retargeting must preserve
the architecture, path and loader geometry. The returned gather spec is validated
again before cache lookup or launch, including segment/reducer and workspace bounds.

## Selection and validation

Use dispatch algorithm `paged_decode_t32` to request T32 explicitly. The
candidate is automatic for page size 1 and opt-in for existing page sizes, so
it preserves their default routing. Explicit `ExplicitAttention3DConfig`
accepts `tile_policy="32"` from `TILE_POLICIES_3D`. Tile tokens share whitespace
and case normalization; `resolve_tile_policy(..., path="3d")` selects the 3D
vocabulary, while the default retains the existing 2D policies.
Direct `backend="3d"` also supports page size 1.
Contiguous non-paged inputs continue to use `kv_layout="strided"`.

The paired `attention_paged_kv_emit` emitters cover both targets, both working
dtypes, D64/128/256 and P1/16/32/64. Host tests cover native byte identity at
LLVM20/22/23, golden hashes, address mapping, artifact identity and admission.
`test_paged_kv_decode_numeric.py` exercises shuffled nonadjacent pages, NaN
padding, page/tile boundaries, empty rows, output canaries, changing lengths,
streams and graph reuse against a CPU FP32 reference after input quantization.
The strided and paged regression suite remains a separate GPU gate.
No performance improvement is claimed.
