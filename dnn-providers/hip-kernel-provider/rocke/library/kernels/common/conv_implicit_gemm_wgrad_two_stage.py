"""Two-stage backward-weight convolution launcher.

Assembles a :class:`~rocke.runtime.launcher.PipelineLauncher` from:

* **Stage 1** — an implicit-GEMM wgrad kernel (``two_stage=True``) that
  f32-atomic-adds its partial sums into a scratch buffer instead of
  16-bit-atomic-adding into ``dW``.
* **Stage 2** — a fold/cast kernel that sums the scratch's ``ws_replicas``
  slabs per group, converts to ``dtype_d``, and writes ``dW``.

This is the route split-K takes when the packed ``<2 x dtype>`` atomic that
writes a 16-bit ``dW`` directly cannot address the problem -- it needs an even
``wg_N = Y*X*cpg``, while ``atomicrmw fadd f32`` has no alignment constraint.
The reduction over ``split_k`` is done by the hardware atomics; what is left
for Stage 2 is the fold over the ``R = ws_replicas`` slabs those atomics were
spread across, which is a compile-time-unrolled ``R`` loads / ``R-1`` adds /
convert / store per element.  ``R`` is independent of ``split_k``, so Stage 2's
cost does not scale with the split degree.

Both stages are submitted on the same HIP stream, so HIP's in-order
execution guarantees Stage 2 begins only after Stage 1 has completed —
no explicit ``hipStreamSynchronize`` is needed between them.

**The caller must zero the scratch before every Stage 1 launch.** Stage 1
accumulates into it; stale content is added to the result.

Grouped convolutions (``groups > 1``) are fully supported.  Stage 1 uses grid
``z = groups * split_k`` and decodes the group from it, so every slice of a
group lands on one of that group's ``R`` scratch slabs (picked by ``z % R``)
and never on another group's.  Stage 2 uses grid ``z = groups`` and folds and
casts all groups in one launch.

Usage::

    from dataclasses import replace
    spec = WgradConvSpec(problem=..., split_k=4, two_stage=True)
    pipeline, ws_nbytes = build_implicit_gemm_conv_wgrad_two_stage(spec, arch=arch)

    ws = DeviceMem(ws_nbytes)
    ws.memset(0)                      # REQUIRED: Stage 1 accumulates

        caller must allocate before each pipeline call.

        The scratch has shape ``[groups * R, wg_M, wg_N]`` (f32), where
