"""What the 8-bit universal GEMM actually emits on gfx1250.

The fp8 path through ``instances/common/gemm_universal.py`` differs from the
fp16/bf16 path in three places that all live in the emitted IR and nowhere else:
the WMMA intrinsic and its operand ABI, the element width of the global A/B
traffic, and the C store type. A spec can be well-formed, pass
``GemmPipelinePolicy.validate``, build without raising, and still be wrong in
any of them -- the result is a kernel that runs and returns numbers.

Two of the three are not symmetric with anything the fp16 path does, which is
why they are asserted here rather than trusted to the byte-identity gate:

* The K=64 fp8 intrinsic takes ``(<8 x i32>, <8 x i32>, i16, <8 x float>, i1,
  i1)`` -- **no** leading ``i1 immarg`` sign-extend flags, unlike the K=32 f16
  form ``(i1, <16 x half>, i1, <16 x half>, i16, <8 x float>, i1, i1)``. Copying
  the f16 call shape is the obvious mistake and produces a signature mismatch
  only at link time, or silently wrong operands if the arity happens to line up.
* A and B are fp8 while C is bf16. Every other GEMM in this family has one dtype
  across all three, so a C that came back ``i8`` would look locally consistent.

The third is the padding zero. ``_zero_storage_scalar`` cannot route +0.0
through ``cast_f32_to`` -- that helper has no 8-bit arm and used to raise -- so
it truncates a zero i32 instead. That arm is reached only when padding is on,
which the tests below exercise from both sides so the assertion is about the
padding path and not about something that is simply always there.

Host-only: ``lower_kernel_to_llvm`` runs the Python lowerer directly, so no
compiler, GPU, or built C++ engine is required.
