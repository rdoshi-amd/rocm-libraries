# The ASM SDPA forward selector revision: 16 hex digits over everything that decides which
# forward kernel runs and how it is launched. L1 models record it and the loader refuses
# a mismatch, so it must hash exactly those inputs: a missing input lets a stale model
# silently pick the wrong engine; an extra one expires models for unrelated changes.
#
# CONFIGURE_DEPENDS makes every input a configure dependency so an edit or a new kernel
# reconfigures. Test fixture trees omit it: they are rewritten on each configure.
