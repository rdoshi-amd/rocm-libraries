# Shipped descriptors

This root holds the descriptors the provider **ships**. Its sibling `test_descriptors/`
stages into the build tree for the unit and integration binaries and is installed only
under `HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ENABLE_TESTS`. It holds one bundle,
`rocKE/gfx950_attention_dense/` (its KDP is stored in DVC, see [Large rocKE files live in DVC](#large-rocke-files-live-in-dvc) below), whose KDP declares gfx950 only, so production packaging
runs for a build whose GPU targets include gfx950 and is dormant for every other build
unless the cache variable below is pointed elsewhere.

## Authoring a bundle

```
descriptors/<producer>/<bundle>/
```

A bundle is authored under the producer that builds its kernels. The subpath is a
convention: `kernel_source.kind` selects the behaviour. `rocKE/` is spelled with
that capitalization because the packer preserves an authored subpath verbatim into the
staged and installed trees. A bundle sits one level under its producer, so every
descriptor lands in a child of its shard root and the archive can be written at the root.

Nothing here is registered in CMake: the packer walks this root recursively, so adding a
bundle is dropping files in a folder. Kernel-source *embedding* is a separate mechanism,
required only for `kernel_source.kind == "embedded_source"`.

A `hip` or `rocke` bundle here is compiled at pack time, one comgr invocation per variant,
on every build that has this root wired — CI included. An `hsaco` bundle is packed as-is:
no comgr and no hipcc run. Trim an authored variant set to a covering subset before it
lands, and register the symbols its UKDs name in a native pack, or the loader refuses the
engine at provider load and every lowered kernel is wasted build time.

The packer does not check an `hsaco` object's format or target processor. Every
`hsaco` UKD must list its `arch`(es) (non-empty; a generic-target object lists every arch
it runs on). `hkp_pack` rejects one without, because an unrestricted `hsaco` UKD would ship
the same bytes into every shard, and they fail at module load on the wrong device.

## Root selection and dormancy

`HIPKERNELPROVIDER_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_ROOT` is a `CACHE PATH` defaulting to this
directory; a consumer needing a different root overrides that variable rather than adding
CMake. Production wiring is gated on at least one non-hidden `*.kdp.json` here, since a
KDP is what architecture pruning consumes. With none, packaging stays dormant and any
stale product tree is removed — not an error. A KDP that *is* present but prunes on every
architecture is a hard failure for a root the build NAMED, and dormancy for this root
reached as the built-in default.

Do not delete this README: git tracks no empty directory, and the cache variable's
set-but-not-a-directory check is fatal.

## Relationship to the examples tree

`descriptor-packaging/examples/descriptors/` is a **test fixture** tree. Bundles are
authored and proved there against the packaging suite, then relocated onto this root once
a native pack registers the symbols their UKDs name. The Linux superbuild CI lane
overrides `HIPKERNELPROVIDER_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_ROOT` to that fixture tree, so that lane
packs the fixtures and never this root.

## Large rocKE files live in DVC

The KDPs (`*.kdp.json`) and any kernel objects (`*.co`, `*.hsaco`) of a rocKE bundle are in
DVC, not git. The other descriptors are small JSON and stay in git. Each DVC file has a
`<name>.dvc` pointer beside it (md5, size, `remote: ingestor`); the file itself is
git-ignored. The blobs are in `s3://therock-dvc/rocm-libraries/hipdnn/ingestor`, which
allows anonymous read.

### Using the bundles

- **Fetch:** TheRock's `fetch_sources.py` pulls every `*.dvc` pointer. By hand:
  `dvc pull -r ingestor <path-to-pointer>.dvc`.
- **`HIPKERNELPROVIDER_ENABLE_ROCKE=ON`:** configure fails if a DVC file is missing or its
  size differs from the pointer, and prints the `dvc pull` command. It checks only the root
  the build packs from, so a `HIPKERNELPROVIDER_PRODUCTION_SOURCE_ROOT` override does not
  need these files.
- **`OFF`:** rocKE descriptors are not consumed. DVC is not needed.

### Adding or changing a large file

```
cd <this dir>/rocKE/<bundle>
dvc add <name>.kdp.json
printf '  remote: ingestor\n' >> <name>.kdp.json.dvc   # new pointers only
dvc remote modify --local ingestor allow_anonymous_login false
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... dvc push -r ingestor
git add <name>.kdp.json.dvc .gitignore
```

- Commit the `.dvc` file in the same change as the push. The pointer diff shows only the new
  md5 and size, so describe the content change in the commit message.
- The committed `.dvc/config` sets `allow_anonymous_login = true` so readers need no
  credentials. DVC then sends unsigned requests and ignores your credentials, so every write
  fails with `AccessDenied`. The `--local` override goes in the git-ignored
  `.dvc/config.local`. The identity needs `s3:PutObject` and `s3:ListBucket` on the
  `ingestor/` prefix. Pass credentials as environment variables, never in a config file.
- `dvc push -r ingestor` uploads everything in your local cache. Do not pull other remotes'
  data into the same worktree first.
