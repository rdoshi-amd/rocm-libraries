Universal-GEMM feature engine extended with fixed vector widths.

The base ``GemmUniversalFeatureEngine`` has no feature for the fixed A/B/C
global vector widths that the GEMM bridge can emit (the ``_vecA_B_C`` kernel
name suffix). Two kernels differing only in those widths therefore produce an
identical feature vector, and a model trained on data that varies them sees the
resulting performance difference as unexplainable noise. On data where the
widths are swept this is not a marginal effect: grouping candidates within a
shape by every knob except the widths leaves groups whose best and worst member
differ by several times.

Six features are added::

    vec_a/b/c         the fixed width per operand, in ELEMENTS, 0 meaning native
    vec_frac_a/b/c    that width over the widest the problem allows

The raw triple alone is not enough because it is **problem-relative**: a kernel
at widths (4, 4, 8) is well matched to a problem whose legal widths are
(4, 4, 8) and strictly wasteful on one allowing (8, 8, 8). The ratio carries
that, and generalises to problems whose absolute widths were never trained on.

Note the raw column mixes a sentinel with an ordinal scale: 0 means *native*,
i.e. the widest legal width, so it sorts below 1 while meaning "largest". The
fraction column is the one with a clean ordering, and it is 1.0 for native by
definition.

``vec_frac`` can exceed 1.0 when a kernel's fixed width does not divide the
problem's legal width. Such a pairing is rejected by the kernel, so it should
not appear in training data; the value is left unclamped so that if it does
appear, it is visible rather than silently indistinguishable from a legal
exact-fit.

Selecting this engine
---------------------
Pass ``--operation gemm_universal_vec`` to ``train.py``; the trained model
records its engine in ``feature_spec.json`` and :class:`predict.Predictor`
reconstructs it, so ``evaluate.py``/``predict.py`` need no flag.

WHY A SUBCLASS AND NOT AN EDIT
------------------------------
The base engine's feature count and encoding maps are pinned by tests, and
``train.py``'s warm-start path (``check_feature_compatibility``) requires an
exact feature-schema match -- so widening the base invalidates every
already-trained model that uses it. Opting in by class keeps those working.
