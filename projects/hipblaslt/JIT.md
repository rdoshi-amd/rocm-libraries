# hipBLASLt just-in-time (JIT) GEMM generation

This source guide describes just-in-time (JIT) kernel generation for general
matrix multiplication (GEMM) in hipBLASLt. It is written for hipBLASLt and
TensileLite contributors and integration developers, and it is maintained under
the existing @ROCm/hipblaslt-reviewers and @ROCm/hipblaslt-docs-reviewers rules
in [.github/CODEOWNERS](../../.github/CODEOWNERS). It is not a released
application programming interface (API) or support statement. Release-document
integration is undecided.

It describes what the code implements today. "Implemented" means present in the
source, not released or approved as product naming. A JIT backend is the
generator that turns a request into kernel sources; this page describes the
parts of hipBLASLt around any backend. The
[JIT test guide](clients/tests/jit/README.md) covers building and running the
tests.

## Summary

hipBLASLt runs a GEMM with a kernel from its pre-tuned library, so a problem
that the library serves poorly, or not at all, has no better kernel available.
JIT generation produces kernels for a problem when they are needed. The `Jit`
component defines the stages of that generation and the order in which they
run. Its interfaces, a comgr code-object builder and a TensileLite solution
loader are implemented. Internal entry points let the JIT test binaries
generate a GEMM solution through a backend and run it with `hipblasLtMatmul`
or `hipblaslt_ext::Gemm`, or publish generated solutions into a persistent
JIT solution library on disk, whose solution indices any later process runs
without generating again. For a backend that consumes a prediction, an Origami
predictor first ranks candidate configurations. In a build with
`HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=ON`, the environment variable `HIPBLASLT_JIT` lets
`hipblasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic`, `GemmInstance::algoGetHeuristic` and
`hipblasLtMatmul` without an algorithm return solutions from that library and
generate the ones it lacks; see
[heuristic integration](#heuristic-integration). The only backend is a test
backend that replays pre-generated source bundles. No generator backend is
implemented yet, so outside the tests those queries report that hipBLASLt was
built without one.

## Current behavior

### Entry points

The internal entry points, in `library/src/amd_detail/hipblaslt-jit.hpp`,
generate through `Jit`, keep generated algorithms in one process-local
registry, and return an algorithm for the existing C and C++ GEMM execution
APIs:

- A backend factory, such as `jit::replay::createBackend`, returns a `Backend`
  handle that owns a `Jit` configured with that backend.
- `jit::makeGemmRequest` captures existing GEMM descriptors and host scalars.
- `jit::getJitAlgo` compiles on the selected device and returns an owned
  `Solution`.
- `jit::getGemmAlgo` adapts the solution to the algorithm that
  `hipblasLtMatmul` and `Gemm` accept.
- `jit::getLibraryAlgos` instead returns solution indices from the
  [JIT solution library](#persistent-solution-library), generating and
  publishing the solutions it lacks; `hipblaslt_ext::getAlgosFromIndex` turns
  them into algorithms.

The header is internal, as are `hipblaslt-jit-replay.hpp` and
`hipblaslt-jit-gemm-internal.hpp`: they are not installed and
`hipblaslt-ext.hpp` does not include them. `libhipblaslt.so` exports four
functions and one type from them with `HIPBLASLT_EXPORT` for the JIT test
binaries, which link against the shared library: `jit::makeGemmRequest`,
`jit::getJitAlgo`, `jit::getGemmAlgo`, `jit::getLibraryAlgos` and the
`jit::detail::GemmRequest` request type. A build with
`HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING=ON` also exports `jit::replay::createBackend`. No
installed header declares them, and they are
not a supported API.

The backend's configuration belongs to the options of its factory. The
application owns its buffers and workspace. The request owns descriptor values
and host scalars; it does not take ownership of device pointers. Compilation
and support checks finish before graphics processing unit (GPU) work is
submitted; call the entry points before stream capture. GEMM is the
implemented operation.

Internally, the GEMM request reuses `RocblasltContractionProblem` with owned
scalar values. The generic `Solution` and private `CompiledSolution` retain
the `Jit`, device target, request, workspace and bundle lifetime around the
existing GEMM support and execution machinery. A matmul algorithm is an
adaptation token, not a general owning executable object.

### Components

`Jit`, in `library/src/amd_detail/hipblaslt-jit-component.{hpp,cpp}`, runs one
request for one device target through these stages. Each stage is an
interface, so that each implementation can be replaced and tested on its own.

| Stage | Interface | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Predict | `Predictor::predict(PredictionRequest, TuningKnowledge, Prediction&)` | Only for a backend that consumes a prediction. Ranks candidates built from the tuning knowledge's seeds, best first, each naming its modeled contract. |
| Generate | `Backend::generate(GenerationRequest, std::vector<GeneratedSolution>&)` | Returns up to `GenerationRequest::count` solutions, best first, and builds and loads nothing. Each `GeneratedSolution` holds a one-solution TensileLite library entry, its main kernel name, and the source units to build. `NotSupported` means the request is outside the backend's domain. |
| Build | `CodeObjectBuilder::build(GeneratedSolution, BuildRequest, BuiltSolution&)` | Builds a solution's units into code objects. `GeneratedSolution` has no code-object field; only `BuiltSolution` adds the main code object and its helpers. |
| Support | `SolutionLoader::support` | Evaluates the entry's predicates and workspace for the request, and loads no code. |
| Publish | `SolutionStore::publish` | Stores built solutions and returns one library index per solution, in order. `SolutionStore::lookup` returns the indices of stored solutions for exactly a request. |
| Load | `SolutionLoader::load` | Loads the code objects into a process-local executable `KernelBundle`. |

`Jit::generate` is the only code that sequences these stages. When the backend
consumes a prediction, it first runs the predictor and passes on only the
candidates whose contract the backend transports. It then asks the
backend for at most the requested count of solutions in a private scratch
directory, forwarding the workspace limit and the kernels the caller already
has. It then builds each solution and checks its support until the count is
reached. With a store it publishes the supported solutions, and loads them only
when publishing fails; without a store it loads them. A failure in one
solution's build, support or load skips that solution and keeps the rest.

Each failure is recorded with its stage (configure, predict, generate, build,
support, load or publish) in `Jit::Outcome::failures`, in the order it happened.
The scratch directory is created under the temporary directory, removed when
the call succeeds, and kept after a failure that left files in it. `Jit`
requires a backend, a builder and a loader; the store is optional. One `Jit`
can generate from several threads at once.

**Contracts and versions.** `BackendInfo::contracts` lists the modeled
contracts a backend transports; an empty set means it consumes no prediction.
`Predictor::modeledContracts()` lists those a predictor emits. A backend with
contracts requires a predictor that shares at least one, and tuning knowledge;
`Jit` rejects the components otherwise. The `Jit`'s version is the backend's
version, followed for such a backend by
`|predictor=<id>;contracts=<shared contracts, sorted>|knowledge=<id>@<version>`.
`Jit` creates its store from `Components::store`, a factory it calls once with
the backend's information and that version, so the cache key changes whenever
the predictor, the shared contracts or the knowledge version change.

**Candidates.** Each `Candidate` names its modeled contract (empty means the
prediction's `modeledContract`), the index of the seed it came from, and
provenance JSON that the backend records. `parameters` are forwarded to the
backend in that contract's vocabulary; `modeled` values are recorded, not
forwarded. A consumer ignores candidate fields it does not know, so contracts
can add fields without breaking older consumers. `ExecutionPolicy` names how a kernel covers
the output tiles: `strategy` is none, data-parallel or Stream-K, and
`assignment` is a static grid, a dynamic work queue or hybrid.

`OperationRequest` names only its kind, so `Jit` sees no GEMM. The interfaces
are for compiled-in implementations and do not establish a stable external
plugin application binary interface (ABI).

The implementations are:

- Predictor: `makeOrigamiPredictor()`, in `hipblaslt-jit-origami-predictor.cpp`,
  puts the tuning knowledge's fixed seeds first, each as one
  `tensilelite.tuned.v1` candidate. It then expands the other seeds across the
  target's matrix instructions, ranks them with Origami, and emits the
  `origami.gemm.dp.v1` contract; see
  [Origami modeled inputs](#origami-modeled-inputs) and
  [predictor and TuningKnowledge](#predictor-and-tuningknowledge).
- Tuning knowledge: `makeCatalogKnowledge()`, in
  `hipblaslt-jit-catalog-knowledge.cpp` (id `catalog.v1`): 11 tile shapes, two
  DepthU rules, cache hints that are only the defaults on gfx90a and gfx1250,
  and policy none for every seed. It supplies no values for unmodeled knobs,
  which keep the backend's defaults.
- Tuning library knowledge: `makeTuningLibraryKnowledge()`, in
  `hipblaslt-jit-tuning-knowledge.cpp` (id `tensilelite-logic.v1`), returns up
  to 8 tuned sets from the knowledge file of the device's architecture, then
  the catalog's seeds. `hipblaslt-jit-knowledge.cpp` reads the files and finds
  the nearest sets.
- Code-object builder: `makeComgrBuilder()`; see
  [building generated sources](#building-generated-sources).
- Loader: `makeTensileLoader()` reads the entry with the Tensile loader (see
  [loading a built solution](#loading-a-built-solution)), checks support and
  workspace with TensileLite's predicates, and returns a process-local
  `TensileGemmBundle`. It is in `rocblaslt/src/tensile_host.cpp`, next to the
  GEMM problem translation that the support check reuses.
- Solution store: the JIT solution library, in `hipblaslt-jit-library.cpp`,
  with `hipblaslt-jit-msgpack.cpp` writing the library files and
  `hipblaslt-jit-fs.cpp` providing the directory checks, file lock and atomic
  replacement. `getLibraryAlgos` sets it as the store of its `Jit`; see
  [persistent solution library](#persistent-solution-library).
- Replay backend: `hipblaslt-jit-replay-backend.cpp` replays a list of source
  bundles without a generator. A generation returns, in list order, up to the
  requested count of bundles whose predicates accept the device and problem,
  skipping excluded kernels; the comgr builder still builds them. Tests reach
  it through `jit::replay::createBackend` in `hipblaslt-jit-replay.hpp`, whose
  `Options::fault` makes generation fail and leave `replay.log` in the scratch
  directory, makes the main kernel's source fail to assemble, makes generation
  append its request to the `Options::record` file and fail, or makes any
  generation abort the process. Given modeled contracts in
  `Options::contracts`, it consumes the predictions of the Origami predictor
  and the catalog knowledge. Only builds with `HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING=ON`
  compile it; it is not a production backend.
- Heuristic integration: `hipblaslt-jit-mode.cpp` reads `HIPBLASLT_JIT`.
  `hipblaslt-jit-process-backend.cpp` configures one `Jit` per process from the
  backend, predictor and tuning knowledge that `makeDefaultProcessBackend`
  returns, with the JIT solution library as its store, and `fillHeuristic` in
  `hipblaslt-jit-backend.cpp` looks a problem up in that library and generates
  what it lacks. `hipblaslt-jit-report.cpp` prints failures, and
  `rocblaslt_auxiliary.cpp` calls these from both heuristic queries. See
  [heuristic integration](#heuristic-integration).

Each build links one definition of `makeDefaultProcessBackend`, chosen when
hipBLASLt is configured. By default it comes from
`hipblaslt-jit-no-backend.cpp`, whose configure failure says that hipBLASLt was
built without a JIT generator backend. With `HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING=ON` it comes
from `hipblaslt-jit-test-backend.cpp`, which replays bundles through the replay
backend after an Origami prediction from the catalog knowledge, transporting
only `origami.gemm.dp.v1`; the
[JIT test guide](clients/tests/jit/README.md) describes its settings.

### Origami modeled inputs

Jit runs the Origami predictor for a backend that consumes the
`origami.gemm.dp.v1` contract. This private contract covers the existing data-parallel candidate
domain. Origami ranks caller-supplied configurations; it does not synthesize
their fields or choose whether to enable Stream-K. Origami's `stream_k=0` and
occupancy 1 remain explicit model inputs, and the recipe keeps TensileLite's
non-persistent `TileProcessingStrategy=None`. Every applicable prediction is transferred;
defaults supply only settings that this model does not predict.

The inventory below follows `shared/origami/include/origami/{origami,gemm,streamk,types}.hpp`
and their implementations. A selected configuration is an output of ranking even
though its fields originate in the caller's candidate catalog.

| Origami output | Generator input or use | Conditions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rank_configs` / `select_config`: ordered configuration and latency | Nine-value `MatrixInstruction` recipe (MI plus retained wave topology), macro tile, `DepthU`, `NonTemporalA/B`; latency and order in provenance | Estimation ranks the existing target instruction/tile/depth/cache-hint catalog. No kernel benchmarking. |
| `select_workgroup_mapping`: signed `wgm` | `WorkGroupMapping` | Preserved exactly; zero and values outside the runtime range are rejected. |
| `select_workgroup_mapping`: `wgmxcc` | `WorkGroupMappingXCC`, with `WorkGroupMappingXCCGroup=0` | Origami 0/1 both mean identity and translate to Tensile 1. Larger values require a supported power of two and a divisible grid for equivalent whole-grid grouping. |
| `select_workgroup_mapping`: `wgmxccchunk`, `wgmxccsplitk` | Retained in every candidate's `modeled.workgroup_mapping` | Nonzero values require the Stream-K mapping ABI and reject the current data-parallel candidate; neither is substituted with `WorkGroupMappingXCCGroup`. |
| `select_staggerU`: `staggerU`, `staggerUMapping` | `StaggerU`, `StaggerUMapping` | All results, including zero, are supplied and checked after derivation. Origami currently returns zero for batches, K splitting, and several no-benefit conditions. |
| `select_staggerU`: `staggerUStrideShift` | `StaggerUStride = DepthU × Tensile DataType bytes × 2^shift` | Check the derived `_staggerStrideShift`; zero stagger may normalize the byte stride without changing its meaning. |
| `gemm::compute_launch_parameters`: reduction, grid, active CUs, timesteps, split factor | `modeled.launch`; `TileProcessingStrategy=None`, `GlobalSplitU=1` | Data parallel derives `none`, output-tile grid and split factor 1. Active CUs/timesteps describe the model, not kernel tuning fields. |
| `streamk::select_reduction`, `select_grid_size` | Mode-dependent prediction APIs | Applicable when a caller enables Stream-K. The data-parallel domain has no reduction/grid tuning prediction to default. Adding Stream-K candidates requires preserving these outputs through Tensile's workspace and launch reconciliation. |
| `streamk::select_hybrid_mode` | Static/dynamic schedule of a Stream-K kernel with `WorkAssignment=Hybrid` | Does not select Stream-K enablement. Inapplicable to the current data-parallel domain. |
| `gemm::predict_workgroup_mapping` | Internal latency-estimation approximation | Alternative fast mapping estimate, not an additional kernel field. The generator receives the full `select_workgroup_mapping` result. |
| Hardware `get_recommended_matrix_instruction` | Alternative throughput-based MI choice | The predictor uses the full instruction catalog plus ranking, preserving the selected MI. |
| GEMM/Formocast performance and resource estimates | Scores/diagnostics | These APIs estimate latency/utilization/resource costs; they do not predict new vector widths, occupancy, or backend tuning settings. |

Unpredicted inputs include wave topology, occupancy, Stream-K enablement and grid
policy, workspace limits, vector widths, subtile/main-loop choice, prefetch and
scheduling, direct-to-LDS/VGPR settings, load coalescing, swizzle/layout and
split-U policy. Some are fixed by the request or candidate domain; others retain
Tensile defaults and derivation. Formocast consumes additional backend settings
to estimate cost; it does not fill them in. Epilogue overhead is not modeled.

A backend that consumes the contract rejects missing modeled fields,
unsupported translations, and any derived recipe that changes a modeled value
or cannot carry it at runtime.
Rejection advances to the next ranked candidate; exhausting the ranking fails
with reasons and emits no selected recipe. A CU budget smaller than the device's
XCD count is rejected before calling the mapping selectors. Diagnostic manifests
retain raw outputs, translated parameters, defaults, and rejections.

### Predictor and TuningKnowledge

The predictor ranks the seeds that the tuning knowledge returns for a request
and a device target. A seed is either a set of fixed tuning parameters or a tile
shape with DepthU rules and cache hints. `makeTuningLibraryKnowledge()` returns
fixed seeds taken from the pre-tuned logic files, then the catalog's seeds.

A build with JIT enabled runs `Tensile.JitKnowledge` over the logic files of each
`GPU_TARGETS` architecture that has them (gfx942, gfx950 and gfx1250). It writes
`Tensile/library/<arch>/hipblaslt-jit-knowledge-<arch>.dat.zlib` and installs it
in the runtime component under `lib/hipblaslt/library/<arch>/`. A build with a
device library installs the file with the rest of that directory. The file holds
every tuned row with its tuned set, unpruned. It is a header index plus one
compressed block per hardware branch and ProblemType group. The gfx942 file is
about 152 MiB, the gfx950 file under 1 MiB.

A backend's provider chooses its tuning knowledge. To use these files, it passes
`makeTuningLibraryKnowledge()` the Tensile library root from
`findTensileLibraryRoot()` in `tensile_host.cpp`, the lookup the pre-tuned
library uses. If `HIPBLASLT_TENSILE_LIBPATH` is set and the process is not
privileged, it names the directory that holds the files. Otherwise they are
under the architecture's directory of `hipblaslt/library` next to
`libhipblaslt`. The headers are read when the first JIT use configures the
components, and a group's block is inflated on the first request that needs it.
With `HIPBLASLT_JIT` unset or `0`, no file is opened.
`HIPBLASLT_JIT_KNOWLEDGE=none` ignores the files. A missing file, a wrong schema
or a file for another architecture also leaves only the catalog. The `knowledge`
debug category reports which applies.

For a GEMM, the matcher uses the first hardware branch, in the device library's
order, that the device matches and that has the request's ProblemType. Exact
branches come before fallback chip IDs. A ProblemType matches when its data
types, transposes and other core fields are equal, and it has every epilogue
feature the request has. The group with the fewest extra features wins. Each set
is as far from the request as its nearest row, measured as the Euclidean
distance between the base-2 logarithms of M, N, batch and K. Ties go to the set
that wastes less of its tiles. The matcher keeps at most two sets per tile and
wave shape, and at most 8 sets.

A fixed seed becomes one candidate with the `tensilelite.tuned.v1` contract. Its
`parameters` are the tuned set's as they are, including the nine-value
`MatrixInstruction`, `DepthU`, `NonTemporalA/B`, the execution policy, the
workgroup mapping and `GlobalSplitU` (with `-1`) and its algorithm, plus the
size asserts that the problem satisfies. Its `modeled` field holds `macro_tile`
(MT0, MT1, DepthU) and `execution` (`strategy`, `assignment`), and its
provenance, sent as `knowledge`, records the branch, group, logic file, row and
distance. Fixed seeds keep the knowledge's order, and Origami's latency orders
seeds that tie. A seed that Origami rejects keeps its place without a latency.
With no workspace, the predictor skips Stream-K seeds and seeds with a fixed
`GlobalSplitU` above 1. The catalog's seeds follow in Origami's order.

`Jit` passes a backend only the candidates whose contract it transports. No
backend in this repository transports `tensilelite.tuned.v1`: the test
backend's replay backend carries only `origami.gemm.dp.v1`, and the test backend
uses the catalog knowledge. Until a generator backend transports tuned sets, the
knowledge files and fixed seeds do not change what JIT generates.

### Pre-tuned heuristic selection

The installed library answers `hipblasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic` and
`GemmInstance::algoGetHeuristic` from pre-tuned TensileLite libraries. Default
construction orders the Equality, Range, Prediction, GridBased and FreeSize
selection libraries, followed by TruePred rows, beneath hardware, operation and
problem predicates. Modes and available branches affect traversal. Equality is
matching with equality distance.

The Prediction library type (C++ `ProblemPredictionLibrary`), also called the
**OrigamiLibrary**, is not a new type. It ships 507 pre-tuned solution YAML
files in per-architecture `Origami` directories under
`library/src/amd_detail/rocblaslt/src/Tensile/Logic/asm_full/`: 489 for gfx950,
7 each for gfx1250 and gfx1250-strict, and 4 for navi32. At runtime it ranks
those existing solutions with `origami::rank_configs`. Origami does not
construct kernels at package time. This existing-solution ranking is distinct
from the JIT predictor, which ranks candidate recipes that may not exist in any
library.

When a problem that requests xf32 math (`rocblaslt_compute_f32_fast_xf32`)
finds no solution, `getBestSolutions` in `tensile_host.cpp` repeats the lookup
with FP32 math. When `getBestSolutions` returns fewer results than
`requestedAlgoCount`, the existing heuristic code in `rocblaslt_auxiliary.cpp`
calls `getAllSolutions`, excluding the GridBased and Prediction libraries that
were already consulted, and appends supported, non-duplicate solutions until the
count is reached. For some eligible problems, another hipBLASLt route answers
`getBestSolutions` and `getAllSolutions` before the Tensile lookup. With
`HIPBLASLT_JIT` set, the [heuristic integration](#heuristic-integration)
extends or replaces this lookup.

### Build

`HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT` is disabled by default. A disabled build compiles and
exports no JIT entry points. The enabled build requires the host library, ROCm
and ROCm's `amd_comgr` CMake package, which only a JIT build links. comgr
compiles helper sources against the host's C and C++ standard library headers,
so those must be installed where JIT runs. From the repository root:

```bash
project_root="$PWD"
project_build="$project_root/projects/hipblaslt/build/release"
cmake -S "$project_root/projects/hipblaslt" -B "$project_build" \
  -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=ON -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_HOST=ON \
  -DHIPBLASLT_BUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_DEVICE=OFF -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx950
cmake --build "$project_build" --parallel
```

`HIPBLASLT_JIT_TESTING`, off by default, also compiles the replay backend into
the library and adds the tests that use it. The
[JIT test guide](clients/tests/jit/README.md) lists the test targets and the
validation commands.

### Algorithm lifetime and failures

The returned heuristic result contains the required workspace size. Supply that
workspace and follow the same handle, stream and workspace sharing rules as
`hipblasLtMatmul` and `Gemm` calls using prebuilt algorithms. The algorithm
resolves to its bundle's one-solution library and adapter, and then runs
through the same launch path as a prebuilt algorithm, including its
synchronization storage. The loader resolves only the main kernel, and a
solution can also launch helper kernels, such as the split-K reduction. For a
JIT algorithm, `hipblasLtMatmul` and `Gemm::initialize` resolve every kernel of
the launch before any is submitted or kept. When the code object lacks one,
the call returns `HIPBLAS_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED` without writing D or the
workspace, and a `Gemm` keeps the launch it had prepared. Registry synchronization
protects algorithm lookup; it does not protect application buffers or make
simultaneous calls on one `Gemm` object safe.

Copies of an algorithm remain usable on its generating device within the same
process, and its modules are retained until process exit. Reuse within one
program invocation needs no recompilation. The opaque algorithm bytes that
`getJitAlgo` and `getGemmAlgo` return are not a library index:
`hipblaslt_ext::getIndexFromAlgo` returns -1 for them, and a different program
invocation cannot use them. Save the bundle manifests for reproduction.

An empty GEMM output (M=0 or N=0) returns `HIPBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` from
the request factory without compilation. K=0 can use a solution that
implements beta*C. The backend owns its datatype, instruction and scale-layout
restrictions. The library propagates support failures, including a mismatch
between the supplied physical MX scale layout and the compiled solution. Jit
never benchmarks generated solutions. A failed build names the retained
`comgr.log` in its message.

### Persistent solution library

The JIT solution library keeps generated solutions on disk so that later
processes run them without generating again. `jit::getLibraryAlgos` is its
entry point: for one request it returns up to the requested number of solution
indices, first the published solutions that match the request, in the order
they were first published, then solutions that `Jit` generates with the
supplied backend and publishes. Any process then passes an index to
`hipblaslt_ext::getAlgosFromIndex`, `hipblasLtMatmul` and `Gemm` as it would a
prebuilt index.

**Location and permissions.** The root is `HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_PATH` or, when
that is unset or empty, `/tmp/hipblaslt-jit-<uid>/` on Linux and
`%TEMP%\hipblaslt-jit-<user>` on Windows. hipBLASLt creates missing directories
with mode 0700. On Linux it refuses the root, and each directory it uses below
the root, when the path is a symbolic link or not a directory, is owned by
another user, or is writable by group or others; a readable directory such as
0755 is accepted. Windows checks only for reparse points and non-directories.
There is no setting that accepts a shared, writable directory. A refused
directory, a privileged (setuid or setgid) process and a build that reads YAML
libraries disable the library for the process, and each use then fails with
`JIT solution library disabled: <reason>`. A prebuilt library that already uses
the reserved index range also disables it.

**Layout.** Under a `v1` schema directory, each cache key has its own
directory, named after the ISA and a 64-bit hash of the key. Each key directory
is a standard lazy TensileLite library that the stock loader reads: a master
file, the index mapping, and one entry (`.dat`) and code object (`.co`) per
solution. For example:

```text
$HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_PATH/
└── v1/
    ├── allocator.dat                  next free solution index
    ├── lock                           publication lock for the whole root
    └── gfx950-677afeae9fbc7f02/       one directory per cache key
        ├── cache-key.json
        ├── TensileLibrary_lazy_gfx950.dat
        ├── TensileLiteLibrary_lazy_gfx950_Mapping.dat
        ├── TensileLibrary_JIT_ad7857c9cccf2981_555e7809bfd8786c.dat
        ├── TensileLibrary_JIT_ad7857c9cccf2981_555e7809bfd8786c.co
        └── staging/                   temporary files before rename
```

An entry name is `TensileLibrary_JIT_<ProblemType hash>_<kernel and size hash>`,
so publishers of the same solution for the same problem choose the same files.
When a name already holds another kernel, the publisher appends `_1`, `_2` and
so on. Each entry holds one solution, with its solution index rewritten to the
allocated one. Each master row is
`And(SizeEqual(M), SizeEqual(N), SizeEqual(batch), SizeEqual(K), <the entry's
problem predicate>)` pointing to a placeholder for the entry, so a lookup
matches only the exact sizes within the full ProblemType. The solution's own
hardware, problem and task predicates, including its workspace requirement,
still run on every match.

**Cache key.** `cache-key.json` records, in canonical JSON:

| Field | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `target` | Full target ID with features (for example `gfx950:sramecc+:xnack-`), ISA, TensileLite library architecture and wavefront size |
| `backend` | Backend identifier and version. Each backend defines its version to change whenever its output can; the replay backend's is a hash of its replayed bundles. For a backend that consumes predictions, the version is followed by `\|predictor=<id>;contracts=<contracts>\|knowledge=<id>@<version>`: the predictor, the modeled contracts that both it and the backend support, sorted, and the tuning knowledge with its version. |
| `comgr` | comgr version, and on Linux the path, size and modification time of the loaded comgr library |
| `code_object_version` | The code-object version that the generator and the builder use (4) |
| `rocm_path` | The ROCm path that the builder passes to comgr |
| `compiler_environment` | `HIP_PATH`, `LLVM_PATH`, and every set `AMD_COMGR_*` variable, such as `AMD_COMGR_DRIVER_OPTIONS_APPEND` and `AMD_COMGR_HOTSWAP_*`, except those that control only comgr's cache, logging, temporary files and statistics |
| `schema` | The library schema version (1) |

A process uses only the directory whose name and `cache-key.json` both match
its key exactly. It ignores other directories and never modifies or deletes
them, and a directory whose `cache-key.json` holds a different key fails the
lookup or publication with a message that says so. To resolve an index it has
not looked up, a process searches the directories for its device whose key
matches everything except the backend, so a later process can run the solution
without configuring the backend that generated it.

**Indices.** JIT solutions use solution indices from 2^30 to `INT32_MAX`.
Prebuilt libraries stay below that range: `TensileCreateLibrary` stops with an
error when a library's solution indices would reach 2^30. `allocator.dat` holds
the next index, so indices stay unique across every key directory under a root
and are never reused while the root exists. Publication fails once the range is
exhausted. `tensile_host.cpp` routes reserved indices to the JIT solution
library, with its own solution adapter whose code-object directory is the key
directory, and all other indices to the prebuilt library. An index that no JIT
library holds resolves to an empty library, so callers report their usual
missing-solution error.

**Publication and refresh.** A publisher holds `lock` (waiting up to 120
seconds) while it allocates indices and writes, in this order: `allocator.dat`,
the code objects, the entries, the mapping and the master. Each file is written
under `staging/` and renamed into place, so readers never see a partial file.
A process that stops at any point leaves a library that loads, whose master
refers only to complete entries; the next publisher reuses or overwrites what
it left. Republishing a published solution writes nothing and returns its
index. Each lookup reloads the master when another process has replaced the
master or mapping file, and resolving an unknown index reloads it too. A
solution already resolved from an earlier master stays valid.

**Clearing.** hipBLASLt never deletes entries. To clear the library, delete
the root directory, or one key directory, while no process is using it.

### Heuristic integration

`HIPBLASLT_JIT` selects the JIT mode for the process. hipBLASLt reads it once,
when the first handle is created.

| `HIPBLASLT_JIT` | Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unset, empty or `0` | Off | Heuristic queries and `hipblasLtMatmul` behave as in a build without JIT. |
| `1` | Fallback | JIT comes after the Equality results: a query takes the Equality results, then JIT solutions, then the results of the other pre-tuned libraries and the `getAllSolutions` fill, each only for what is still missing. |
| `2` | Forced | JIT is the only source. The query skips the override file, every pre-tuned library, every other hipBLASLt source and the `getAllSolutions` fill. |

Any other value leaves JIT off and prints
`hipblaslt warning: HIPBLASLT_JIT=<value> is not 0, 1 or 2; JIT is off` once.
A build without JIT ignores a nonzero value and prints
`hipblaslt warning: HIPBLASLT_JIT=<value> is ignored: hipBLASLt was built without HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT`
once. Privileged processes ignore the variable.

**Order.** In fallback mode, `hipblasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic` and
`GemmInstance::algoGetHeuristic` take results from these sources in turn, each
only for what is still missing from `requestedAlgoCount`:

1. The override file.
2. The Equality rows of the pre-tuned libraries.
3. JIT. It looks the problem up in the JIT solution library under the process's
   cache key. If that is still short, `Jit` generates the rest: the predictor
   ranks candidates when the backend consumes a prediction, the backend
   generates solutions, comgr builds them, and the library publishes them.
   Every kernel that the query has already returned is excluded by name, and
   the backend returns only kernels it has not already returned for the
   request, so each new result is a different kernel.
4. The other pre-tuned libraries: the Range, Prediction (Origami), GridBased and
   FreeSize rows and the MLP rows.
5. The `getAllSolutions` fill.

JIT results count toward the request, so a query that the Equality results
fill does not consult JIT. Its results can still differ from those with JIT
off. The pre-tuned library walks its hardware branches in order, a branch that
names a device or CU count before the generic one. With JIT off, a single walk
takes each branch's Equality rows and then its other rows, and stops when the
request is full. The fallback-mode Equality pass takes the Equality rows of
every branch first, so when the first matching branch's Equality rows do not
fill the request, an Equality result of the generic branch can take a place
that, with JIT off, goes to a result of the specific branch's other rows. The
results are those of JIT off when only one branch matches or when the first
matching branch's Equality rows fill the request. The sources after JIT skip
the kernels its results use. When the override entry names a JIT solution, the
JIT results do not repeat its kernel. When neither pre-tuned pass finds a
solution for an xf32 problem, both repeat with FP32 math; JIT runs once for the
query. When another hipBLASLt route answers the problem before the Tensile
lookup, its results come first and JIT fills only what is still missing after
the `getAllSolutions` fill.

In forced mode, the JIT lookup and generation are the whole query. Each JIT
result passes the same support and workspace checks as a `getAllSolutions`
result. Its solution index is in the reserved JIT range.

**Return count.** Returning fewer results than requested, including none, is
success, as it already was for the pre-tuned lookup. In fallback mode, a query
whose pre-tuned lookup failed, for example because no pre-tuned library could
be loaded, succeeds when JIT adds a result and otherwise keeps its error. In
forced mode the query succeeds even when JIT fails; it then returns no results
and reports the failure.

**`hipblasLtMatmul` without an algorithm.** In fallback mode it runs the first
solution of the same order: an Equality result, else a JIT solution, else a
result of the other pre-tuned libraries. When another hipBLASLt route answers the
problem before the Tensile lookup, it uses a JIT solution only when that route
finds none. In forced mode it uses only JIT solutions. When no solution is found
it returns `HIPBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`.

**Failure reporting.** JIT problems are printed on stderr without any
`HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL` setting, once per distinct message in a process, and are
also passed to the existing error or info log. A failure is an error when the
query gets no JIT result and a warning when JIT still added one. A shortfall
without a failure is a warning. Each line names the stage (configure, predict,
generate, build, support, load, lookup or publish), the problem and the cause.
A generation or build failure names its kept log:

```text
hipblaslt error: JIT configure failed for GEMM M=256 N=128 K=512 batch=1 opA=OP_N opB=OP_N A=R_16F B=R_16F C=R_16F D=R_16F compute=COMPUTE_32F epilogue=EPILOGUE_DEFAULT: hipBLASLt was built without a JIT generator backend
hipblaslt error: JIT predict failed for GEMM M=256 N=128 K=0 ... EPILOGUE_DEFAULT: JIT GEMM prediction: No Origami ranking: no finite positive-latency candidates for this request
hipblaslt error: JIT build failed for GEMM M=256 N=128 K=512 ... EPILOGUE_DEFAULT: comgr could not assemble: /tmp/comgr-3939069-4-b17d31/input/0-<kernel>.s:1:1: error: invalid instruction; see /tmp/hipblaslt-jit-Vr6yTk/comgr.log
```

A shortfall warning, such as `hipblaslt warning: JIT returned 1 of 2 requested
solutions for GEMM ...`, ends with the backend's summary of its generation.

Once generation falls short for a problem, later queries for it in the same
process look it up in the library but do not generate again. Queries for the
same problem and workspace limit in one process generate one at a time, so the
second one finds what the first published. Separate processes can generate the
same solutions at once; they publish under the library lock, which keeps one
entry and one index per solution, so every process returns the same indices.
An empty output (M=0 or N=0) gets no JIT result. A problem that Origami cannot
rank, such as K=0, reports a predict failure. Grouped GEMM is not supported and
reports an error.

**Stream capture.** `hipblasLtMatmul` without an algorithm checks its stream
with `hipStreamIsCapturing`; the null and legacy streams never capture. While
the stream captures, in any capture mode, JIT only looks up solutions already
published to the JIT solution library: it starts no generation, comgr build or
publication, and the other sources keep their order. A published solution
whose code object the process has not loaded yet is loaded during the capture,
as pre-tuned code objects are; HIP allows module loads in every capture mode,
and the capture stays valid. When nothing is found the call returns
`HIPBLAS_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`, as outside a capture, and reports one line:

```text
hipblaslt error: JIT generation skipped during stream capture for GEMM M=256 N=128 K=576 ... EPILOGUE_DEFAULT
```

When a pre-tuned solution is found instead, the skipped generation goes only to
the info log.

The heuristic queries take no stream and may generate during a capture: they
follow the mode as they do outside one. Generating inside a capture was verified
to keep the capture valid in global, thread-local and relaxed capture modes
with HIP 7.17. Generation takes seconds, so warm the JIT solution library or run
the query before the capture: run the same queries beforehand, in this process
or an earlier one, or run the query first and pass the returned algorithm to
`hipblasLtMatmul` inside the capture.

A query that generates waits for the whole generation. Generation runs in a new
directory under the system temporary directory (`TMPDIR` on Linux). It is
removed after success and kept after a failure, whose report names the log
inside it.

### Diagnostics with `HIPBLASLT_JIT_DEBUG`

In a JIT build with `HIPBLASLT_JIT` set to `1` or `2`, `HIPBLASLT_JIT_DEBUG`
prints where JIT time goes and what JIT is doing. Its value is a
comma-separated list of category names, in any case:

| Name | Lines |
| --- | --- |
| `timing` | One line when each heuristic query, `hipblasLtMatmul` call, generation and generated solution finishes, with the duration of each step |
| `progress` | One line per step as it happens: lookups, waits, generation stages, builds and publication |
| `knowledge` | Which tuning knowledge each architecture uses |
| `prediction` | Reserved; no lines yet |
| `all` | Every category, including categories added later |

Unset or empty prints nothing. A number, including `0` and `1`, or an unknown
name prints `hipblaslt warning: HIPBLASLT_JIT_DEBUG=<value>: ignoring <names>;
the value is timing, progress, knowledge, prediction or all, comma-separated` once and is ignored; the
names beside it still apply. hipBLASLt reads the variable once per process.
With `HIPBLASLT_JIT` off, and in a build without JIT, it prints nothing and no
warning.

The lines go to stderr. `HIPBLASLT_JIT_DEBUG_FILE` names a file to append them
to instead, with `%i` replaced by the process ID; the file is created readable
and writable by its owner only. Each line is written whole, so threads and
processes that share a file never split a line. A file that cannot be opened
prints one warning, and the lines go to stderr. The lines are not copied into
the hipBLASLt log.

Every line is the prefix `hipblaslt jit-debug ` followed by one JSON object,
so `grep '^hipblaslt jit-debug '` separates the lines and one JSON parser reads
them. The object starts with these keys:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `v` | Schema version, `1`. New keys keep the version; a changed meaning increments it |
| `cat` | `timing`, `progress` or `knowledge` |
| `ev` | The event |
| `pid`, `tid` | The process ID and a thread number counted from 1 in each process |
| `t_ms` | Milliseconds on the monotonic clock since the process's first line |
| `q` | The query the line belongs to, `<pid>.<n>`, or `null` |
| `gen` | Inside a generation, the generation, `<pid>.g<n>` |

Durations are nanoseconds in an `ns` object, in the order the steps ran, and
each includes the steps nested in it. A string longer than 512 bytes is cut and
the line gets `"truncated":true`; most generated kernel names are, and the
solution index identifies the solution. A line longer than 4 KiB keeps only the
keys above, with `"truncated":true` and its full size as `oversize`.

`timing` lines:

| `ev` | When and what |
| --- | --- |
| `process` | First line of the process: the mode, the categories, the destination, the wall-clock time and `AMD_COMGR_CACHE`. Without `timing`, it is a line of the first category on, in the order `progress`, `knowledge` |
| `setup` | The first JIT use in the process: its `status`, and the time to open the JIT solution library (`store`) and create the components. A backend can add its own fields and steps, such as creating itself |
| `library.init` | A device's pre-tuned library initialization |
| `query` | Each heuristic query, `api` `c` or `cpp`: `requested`, `returned`, the problem, `from` (the results each source added: `override`; `best` from the pre-tuned query, split into `equality`, `jit` and `others` when JIT runs between them; `all` from the `getAllSolutions` fill; otherwise `jit` after them; in forced mode only `jit`), `jit` (results `needed` and found as `hits`, `hits_after_wait`, `kept` and `dropped` by the support check, and `waited_on`, the generation another thread ran while this one waited), `gen` when it generated, and the step durations |
| `matmul` | `hipblasLtMatmul` without an algorithm or with a JIT solution: the first call for each problem and algorithm, and every call that generated, loaded a code object (`loaded` is `now`) or skipped generation during a capture, with the selection, library lookup, preparation, code-object load and launch durations |
| `generation` | Each generation: the requested and candidate counts, failures, the problem, the generated, `fresh`, `reused` and published counts, and the durations of prediction, scratch, the backend, building, support checks, publication (lock wait, time holding the lock, refresh) and loading, with `other` the rest. A backend can add its own fields and the durations of its own steps within `backend` |
| `solution` | One per generated solution: rank, kernel, `outcome` (`built`, `build_failed`, `unsupported`, `published`, `publish_failed`, `loaded` or `load_failed`), index, message, assembly and HIP unit counts with each HIP unit's compile time as `hip_units`, and the metadata, assembly, HIP compile, link, build and support durations |
| `query.aggregate`, `matmul.aggregate` | At most once per second, and at exit: the calls not printed in full, per API or per problem and algorithm, as `calls`, `ns.sum` and `ns.max` |

`progress` lines:

| `ev` | When and what |
| --- | --- |
| `query.start`, `query.end` | A heuristic query or `hipblasLtMatmul` without an algorithm starts and ends |
| `lookup` | The JIT solution library lookup: `result` (`hit`, `partial` or `miss`), `found` and `needed` |
| `capture.skip` | Generation skipped because the stream is being captured |
| `generation.wait` | The query waited for another thread's generation of the same problem, named in `waited_on` |
| `generation.repeated` | The problem fell short in an earlier generation in this process, so it is not generated again |
| `generation.start`, `generation.end` | A generation starts, with the requested and candidate counts and the problem, and ends, with `outcome` (`ok`, `partial`, `failed` or `empty`) and the generated, published and loaded counts |
| `build.start`, `build.end` | Each solution's code-object build, with its `outcome` |
| `publish.start`, `publish.done` | Publication into the JIT solution library, with `fresh` and `reused` entries |
| `load.done` | Solutions loaded without publication |
| `failure` | A failed stage and its message |

`knowledge` lines:

| `ev` | When and what |
| --- | --- |
| `load` | Once per architecture, at its first request: the `arch`, the file's `path`, and `status`: `loaded` with the file's `content_hash` and number of `groups`, or `catalog` with the `reason` only the catalog applies |
| `corrupt` | A group's block that cannot be read: the `arch`, `path` and `reason`. That group gives no seeds for the rest of the process |

`query.start`, `query.end`, `lookup` and `query` lines share a budget of 50
lines that refills at 10 per second. Lines over the budget are counted and
reported by a `suppressed` line in their category before the next line that is
written, and a dropped `query` line is added to `query.aggregate`. Repeated
`matmul` calls go to `matmul.aggregate`. Generation lines are never dropped.

A cache hit with `HIPBLASLT_JIT_DEBUG=timing`:

```text
hipblaslt jit-debug {"v":1,"cat":"timing","ev":"query","pid":4242,"tid":1,"t_ms":160.737,"q":"4242.5","api":"cpp","mode":1,"requested":3,"returned":3,"problem":"GEMM M=256 N=128 K=512 batch=1 opA=OP_N opB=OP_N A=R_16F B=R_16F C=R_16F D=R_16F compute=COMPUTE_32F epilogue=EPILOGUE_DEFAULT","from":{"equality":0,"jit":3,"others":0,"best":3},"jit":{"needed":3,"hits":3,"kept":3,"dropped":0},"ns":{"total":55459,"jit_target":3580,"lookup_attach":14910,"lookup_refresh":7870,"lookup_scan":12040,"jit_lookup":38570,"jit_support":3880,"jit":49950,"others":1670,"get_best":54129}}
```

The start of a generation with `HIPBLASLT_JIT_DEBUG=progress`:

```text
hipblaslt jit-debug {"v":1,"cat":"progress","ev":"lookup","pid":4242,"tid":1,"t_ms":155.350,"q":"4242.1","result":"miss","found":0,"needed":2}
hipblaslt jit-debug {"v":1,"cat":"progress","ev":"generation.start","pid":4242,"tid":1,"t_ms":155.791,"q":"4242.1","gen":"4242.g1","requested":2,"candidates":72,"problem":"GEMM M=256 N=128 K=512 batch=1 opA=OP_N opB=OP_N A=R_16F B=R_16F C=R_16F D=R_16F compute=COMPUTE_32F epilogue=EPILOGUE_DEFAULT"}
```

Unset, empty, with `HIPBLASLT_JIT` off, or in a build without JIT, the
variable adds no lines, files or clock reads. With any
value, the results, return statuses, JIT solution library contents and the
other stderr output are the same as without it, and a line that cannot be
written never fails a call.

### Building generated sources

Generators emit assembly or HIP source plus metadata only; they do not assemble,
link or bundle. `makeComgrBuilder()` returns the `CodeObjectBuilder` that builds
code objects in process through AMD comgr (`hipblaslt-jit-builder.cpp` and
`hipblaslt-jit-code-object.cpp`). It uses three comgr actions:

- Assembly: `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_ASSEMBLE_SOURCE_TO_RELOCATABLE`. A unit's
  `.amdgcn_target` directive must name the device's processor and only
  features the device has; it is then rewritten to the device's full target
  ID. Assembly units that declare different wavefront sizes are rejected.
- HIP helper source: `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_COMPILE_SOURCE_TO_RELOCATABLE` with
  `--rocm-path` and a content-derived `-cuid`, so helper objects link together.
  The ROCm path is `HIP_PATH` when set, otherwise the prefix of the loaded HIP
  runtime.
- Link: `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_LINK_RELOCATABLE_TO_EXECUTABLE` joins the main kernel
  and helper relocatables into one code object per solution, with
  `-Xlinker --build-id=sha1`.

The generator and the builder use the same code-object version, which
`GenerationRequest::codeObjectVersion` and `BuildRequest::codeObjectVersion`
carry (4 by default). The output is a
raw, uncompressed executable code object. comgr cannot bundle or compress it,
and `hipModuleLoadData` accepts raw executable and linkable format (ELF)
objects. A generator needs no offload bundler.

After linking, the builder reads the code object's metadata and checks that its
instruction set architecture (ISA) is the device's and that it defines the
solution's main kernel. A build failure has the build stage. Its message
carries the first error line of the comgr log, and the builder appends the full
log to `comgr.log` in `BuildRequest::scratch` and names that file in the
message.

comgr's own on-disk cache (`~/.cache/comgr`) keeps its default: hipBLASLt never
sets `AMD_COMGR_CACHE`. That cache holds the results of comgr actions for every
comgr user in the process, such as hipRTC, and comgr reads its setting once per
process.

### Loading a built solution

`hipblaslt-jit-loader.{hpp,cpp}` turns a built TensileLite solution into a
loaded one-solution library:

- `readTensileSourceBundle` reads a source bundle into a `GeneratedSolution`:
  the library entry, its main kernel name, each `sources/*.s` as a main
  assembly unit, and `sources/Kernels.cpp` with its headers as a helper unit.
- `parseTensileBundle` reads a built solution's entry into a TensileLite
  `MasterSolutionLibrary` for the device's hardware. It requires exactly one
  local solution, index 0, named after the built kernel, and loads no code.
- `loadTensileBundle` loads the main and helper code objects into a new
  `SolutionAdapter` and resolves the main kernel.

The entry's own hardware and problem predicates decide which problems the
solution serves, so `findBestSolution` on the loaded library selects it only
for the problems it was generated for.

### Source bundle format

A source bundle is a generated solution stored as a directory.
`source_bundle::readSourceBundle`, in `hipblaslt-jit-source-bundle.hpp`, reads
one by directory convention:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `library/TensileLibrary.dat` | The one-solution library entry, stored as uncompressed MsgPack |
| `sources/*.s` | The main kernel assembly; at least one |
| `sources/Kernels.cpp` | The helper kernels, when the solution needs helpers |
| Other files in `sources/` | Headers that the helper source includes |
| `manifest.json` | A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) provenance record that hipBLASLt does not read |

Artifact paths must be relative and stay inside the bundle, including through
symbolic links, and `sources/` may hold only regular files. The reader bounds
the file count (1024), each file (64 MiB) and the sources in total (256 MiB).

The JIT tests use gfx950 source bundles committed in `clients/tests/jit/data`:
`plain`, with no helper kernels; `splitk`, whose split-K solution launches
helper kernels from `Kernels.cpp`; and `streamk` and `amax`, a Stream-K
solution and an output-amax solution. Each manifest records the
kernel-argument and persistent-loop argument layout versions of the generator
that wrote it, and [their README](clients/tests/jit/data/README.md) gives the
commands that generated them. The `jit-bundle-freshness` test fails when those
versions or the code-object version no longer match this tree, or when the
host library or comgr can no longer read or build a bundle.
