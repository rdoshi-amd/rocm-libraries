# Validate the JIT implementation

The JIT tests check the comgr code-object builder, the source bundle reader,
the JIT solution library, the TensileLite loader and, through the replay
backend, the internal entry points that run a JIT solution with the GEMM APIs.
The JIT headers are not installed. The tests include them from
`library/src/amd_detail`. They build the gfx90a, gfx942 and gfx950 kernel
assembly committed in [`data`](data/README.md) and publish it into a JIT
solution library, so they need neither Python nor a generator. Replay tests
stage a temporary source directory from the same descriptions. That directory
is the input `readTensileSourceBundle` already accepts.

## Build and run from a checkout

From the repository root, with `project_build` set as in the
[JIT build instructions](../../../JIT.md#build):

```bash
cmake -S projects/hipblaslt -B "$project_build" \
  -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=ON -DHIPBLASLT_BUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_HOST=ON -DHIPBLASLT_ENABLE_DEVICE=OFF -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx950
cmake --build "$project_build" --parallel
ctest --test-dir "$project_build/clients/tests/jit" -L jit-cpu --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir "$project_build/clients/tests/jit" -L jit-gpu --output-on-failure
```

`-L jit-cpu` runs the tests that need no GPU. `-L jit-gpu` runs the tests that
need device 0. `GPU_TARGETS` is that device's architecture, `gfx90a`, `gfx942`
or `gfx950`; the command above uses `gfx950`. The publish, load, replay,
library and heuristic tests use the committed assembly of that architecture,
the same way on each of the three. Each test empties its own directory
under `clients/tests/jit/scratch` in the build directory before it runs, except
`jit-loader`, which reads the library `jit-publish` wrote.

The CTest tests are:

- `jit-cpu`: `jit-source-bundle` and `jit-builder`. A build with
  `HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=OFF` has `jit-source-bundle` and `jit-disabled`.
- `jit-gpu`: `jit-publish`, `jit-loader`, `jit-library`,
  `jit-library-concurrency`, `jit-end-to-end`, `jit-end-to-end-library`,
  `jit-heuristic-off`, `jit-heuristic-fallback` and `jit-heuristic-forced`,
  when `GPU_TARGETS` include an architecture with committed assembly. CTest
  runs `jit-publish` before `jit-loader`. A build with
  `HIPBLASLT_JIT_ENABLE_HIPKITTENS=ON` and gfx950 also has `jit-hipkittens`.
  The library tests load no code, but TensileLite queries the current device
  when it reads a library entry, and they publish the `plain` entry of that
  architecture. Replay and the heuristic queries use its `plain-pair`. A build
  with `HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=OFF` has `jit-heuristic-ignored` instead, which
  sets `HIPBLASLT_JIT=2` and requires that the queries still do not return JIT
  algorithms. A build with `HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_YAML=ON` has none of the MsgPack
  tests.

## What each test checks

| CTest test | Behavior under test |
| --- | --- |
| `jit-source-bundle` | The source bundle reader: assembly, HIP sources and headers sorted by name, relative paths, symbolic links that escape the bundle, size limits, and a library entry that is missing, empty or not named `library/TensileLibrary.dat` |
| `jit-builder` | The comgr builder, without a GPU, building the hand-written HIP kernel `builder_test_kernel.hip` for each committed assembly target, then each assembly file linked with that kernel into one code object; each code object defines its kernels and has the builder's code-object version, and a kernel name it does not define fails the build |
| `jit-publish` | Builds the device's committed assembly and publishes it into the JIT solution library: `plain` for K=512, and `plain-pair`'s two solutions for K=1024 and K=256. Indices are at least `2^30` |
| `jit-loader` | Loads that library, finds each published solution and the pre-generated kernel, resolves the kernel from its code object, and finds nothing for a transposed A. An entry whose solutions are not 0 to N-1 is rejected. Launches no kernel |
| `jit-end-to-end` | `plain-pair` replayed and built with comgr. `getJitAlgo` publishes its first solution for K=512 and its second for K=256 as JIT library indices, and each runs through `hipblasLtMatmul` and `hipblaslt_ext::Gemm` with D checked against a host reference. A second lookup returns the same index from the library without generating. A problem neither solution solves is not supported |
| `jit-end-to-end-library` | `getLibraryAlgos` publishes the first `plain-pair` solution for K=512 and the second for K=256 into a fresh JIT solution library, each as its own entry, and returns two reserved indices, which `getAlgosFromIndex` and `hipblasLtMatmul` run with checked numerics. Later queries return the same indices from the library without generating. A second process runs the indices before any query, then finds them the same way |
| `jit-library` | The JIT solution library: cache-key fields and compiler-environment filtering; rejected group- or other-writable, linked and non-directory roots; the stock TensileLite loader reading a published library; exact-size matching with the solution predicates still applied; deduplication, hash collisions, order, count and excluded kernels; mismatched and tampered keys ignored and left untouched; index allocation up to `INT32_MAX` and exhaustion; a publisher killed after each publication step; readers reloading after another instance publishes; and a fused GEMM and all-to-all problem rejected by lookup, publication and the ProblemType key without touching the library, even beside a plain solution of the same sizes |
| `jit-library-concurrency` | Eight processes publish shared and private entries into one library while another process looks them up: shared entries get one index, private ones unique indices with no gaps, and every reader snapshot loads |
| `jit-disabled` | The JIT headers are absent from the public include tree, `hipblaslt-ext.hpp` compiles without them, and the extension API links against the disabled library |
| `jit-heuristic-off` | `HIPBLASLT_JIT=0`. Both heuristic queries for the plain-pair FP16 GEMM return no JIT algorithm |
| `jit-heuristic-fallback` | `HIPBLASLT_JIT=1`. With no device library, every returned algorithm is JIT and the first result for K=512 matches the host. With a device library, an Equality size returns Equality algorithms, then JIT, then the others, with no repeated kernel, and an untuned size starts with JIT. Without such a library the ordering check prints `SKIP heuristic-provider-order: the build has no device library with an Equality size` |
| `jit-heuristic-forced` | `HIPBLASLT_JIT=2`. Both queries return only JIT library indices. K=512 selects the solution ending in `_K512_WGM8` and K=256 the one ending in `_WGM1`. A transposed A returns no algorithm. The first K=512 result matches the host. A second process querying that problem gets the same index |
| `jit-heuristic-ignored` | Built only with `HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_JIT=OFF`, with `HIPBLASLT_JIT=2`. The queries do not return JIT algorithms |
| `jit-hipkittens` | Built only with `HIPBLASLT_JIT_ENABLE_HIPKITTENS` and gfx950. The compiled-in BF16 and FP16 variants, a capturing stream that returns no solution without compiling when the library is empty, a BF16 TN 256x256x128 GEMM whose D is 128 and which publishes a library index, a later capture that returns that index without compiling, and M=128 rejected |

## Test arguments

The tests are Catch2 executables and take no arguments. CMake compiles in the
data directory, the library directory and the HIP kernel path. Run
`jit-publish` before `jit-loader`; the loader reads the library the publisher
wrote. Problems are FP16 with M=256, N=128 and K=512, 1024 or 256.

`hipblaslt-jit-end-to-end-test` stages `plain-pair` from that data directory.
It creates the replay backend with `jit::replay::createBackend` from
`hipblaslt-jit-replay.hpp`, so generation runs no generator, and solves FP16
problems with M=256, N=128 and K=512 or 256. CTest sets `HIPBLASLT_JIT_E2E_MODE`
to `run` or `library`, and `HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_PATH` to a scratch directory.
The test empties that directory first and refuses to run unless it is set, so
it never publishes into the default library. `getJitAlgo` returns a JIT library
index, and a second lookup of the same problem returns that index without
generating. The `library` mode starts a second process, which sets
`HIPBLASLT_JIT_E2E_MODE` to `library-reader` and runs the published indices
before any query of its own.

`hipblaslt-jit-heuristic-test` reads `HIPBLASLT_JIT_TEST_MODE`: `off`,
`fallback`, `forced`, `ignored`, or `reuse`. CTest sets that mode,
`HIPBLASLT_JIT`, and a private `HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_PATH`. The test stages
`plain-pair` and sets `HIPBLASLT_JIT_TEST_REPLAY` before either heuristic
query. A JIT heuristic result is a solution library index from 2^30. `reuse`
is the second process: it queries K=512 once and prints that index. Its Catch2
reporter is sent to `/dev/null`, so the parent reads only that line.

## JIT solution library tests

`hipblaslt-jit-library-test` compiles the JIT solution library directly. It
publishes the `plain` entry of the device's architecture under several kernel
names with stand-in code objects. CTest sets `HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_SCRATCH`
to the directory for those libraries. The test ignores
`HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_PATH`. The concurrency entry also sets
`HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_WRITERS` and `HIPBLASLT_JIT_LIBRARY_PER_WRITER`: that
many writer processes each publish that many entries shared by all writers and
that many of their own, while one reader process looks them up.
