********************************
Using hipBLASLt offline tuning
********************************

``hipblaslt-bench`` can find the best-performing GEMM kernel for a given set of GEMM problems and record
its solution index in a tuning file, which later GEMM calls use through the User Offline Tuning mechanism.
A recorded index belongs to the device architecture it was measured on, and another build of hipBLASLt
uses it only while it still names the same kernel; see `How tuned entries are validated`_.

Use the command line interface to access this functionality. See :ref:`clients` for more details.

Using hipblaslt-bench to run the tuning with the best GEMM kernel
=================================================================

To find and use the best GEMM kernel for a problem, follow these steps:

#. Generate the tuning command line by setting the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32`` before calling any hipBLASLt APIs. For more details on how to use ``hipblaslt-bench``, see :ref:`Logging and heuristics <logging-heuristics>`.
   In the Bash shell, set the following environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32

#. The following command uses `sample_hipblaslt_gemm.cpp <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/develop/projects/hipblaslt/clients/samples/01_hipblaslt_gemm/sample_hipblaslt_gemm.cpp>`_ as an example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./sample_hipblaslt_gemm

   The tuning command displays the following log entry:

   .. code-block:: bash

      hipblaslt-bench --api_method c -m 1024 -n 512 -k 1024 --lda 1024 --ldb 1024 --ldc 1024 --ldd 1024  --stride_a 0 --stride_b 0 --stride_c 0 --stride_d 0  --alpha 1.000000 --beta 1.000000 --transA N --transB N --batch_count 1  --a_type f16_r --b_type f16_r --c_type f16_r --d_type f16_r --scale_type f32_r --bias_type f32_r   --compute_type f32_r --algo_method index --solution_index 56073

#. Set the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE=<file_name>`` and run the command. ``hipblaslt-bench`` then tunes the
   problem with hipBLASLt's own tune mode, the tuner that ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=tune`` uses (see `Runtime tuning`_), appends the
   winner to ``<file_name>``, and times the winner.

   In the Bash shell, set the following environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE=tuning.txt

   Candidates must fit in the workspace limit, which you can set with:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_USER_MAX_WORKSPACE=<value> (Default value is: 128 * 1024 * 1024)

   These ``hipblaslt-bench`` options set how candidates are measured, and their defaults change in the tuning environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      --iters |-i <value>             (Default value is: 1000)
      --cold_iters |-j <value>        (Default value is: 1000)
      --requested_solution <value>    (Default value is: -1)
      --rotating <value>              (Default value is: 512)

   Each candidate gets ``--cold_iters`` untimed launches and then ``--iters`` timed ones, against ``--rotating`` megabytes of
   rotating memory, with the instruction cache flushed between launches. ``--requested_solution -1`` measures
   every kernel that can run the problem, and a positive value measures that many of the heuristic's top-ranked kernels. The
   search has no time limit unless ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE`` sets one. A problem the file already holds is not
   tuned again. Grouped GEMM and pointer-array batched problems are not tuned.

   After the tuning completes, the expected output is displayed as follows:

   .. code-block:: none

      tuning-cache: mode=tune path=tuning.txt load=not-found loaded=0
      tuning-cache: tuning-start m=1024 n=512 k=1024 batch=1 trans=NN types=f16_r/f16_r; this call will block until it finishes
      tuning-cache: tuning-done winner=56537 elapsed=78.9s persisted=yes
      [0]:transA,transB,grouped_gemm,batch_count,m,n,k,alpha,lda,stride_a,beta,ldb,stride_b,ldc,stride_c,ldd,stride_d,a_type,b_type,c_type,d_type,compute_type,scaleA,scaleB,scaleC,scaleD,amaxD,swizzle_a,swizzle_b,activation_type,bias_vector,bias_type,aux_type,rotating_buffer,flush,use_gpu_timer,hipblaslt-Gflops,hipblaslt-GB/s,us
          N,N,0,1,1024,512,1024,1,1024,1048576,1,1024,524288,1024,524288,1024,524288,f16_r,f16_r,f16_r,f16_r,f32_r,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,none,0,f16_r,f16_r,512,1,0,66613.8,363.509,16.1189
          --Solution index: 56537
          --Solution name:  <solution_name>
          --kernel name:    <kernel_name>
      tuning-cache: summary shapes=1 matched=1 fellback=0 tuned=1 invalidated=0

   The ``tuning-cache`` lines go to standard error and the rest to standard output. The time printed is ``hipblaslt-bench``'s own
   measurement of the winner, which can differ from the time the tuner recorded in the file.


#. Set the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE=<file_name>`` to load the tuning file and override
   the default kernel selection with the optimal kernel choices, where ``<file_name>`` points to the tuning file.

   In the Bash shell, set the following environment variable:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE=tuning.txt

   For example, you can use ``hipblaslt-bench`` with ``algo_method`` set to ``heuristic`` to obtain the solutions for a problem,
   which include the best tuning solution index.

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./hipblaslt-bench --api_method c -m 1024 -n 512 -k 1024 --lda 1024 --ldb 1024 --ldc 1024 --ldd 1024  --stride_a 0 --stride_b 0 --stride_c 0 --stride_d 0  --alpha 1.000000 --beta 1.000000 --transA N --transB N --batch_count 1  --a_type f16_r --b_type f16_r --c_type f16_r --d_type f16_r --scale_type f32_r --bias_type f32_r   --compute_type f32_r --algo_method heuristic --requested_solution 1 --print_kernel_info

          --kernel name:    <kernel_name>

How tuned entries are validated
===============================

A tuning file records a ``kernel_name`` next to each ``solution_index``. When the file is replayed,
the index is treated as a lookup hint: hipBLASLt resolves it in the current library and uses it only
if it still names the same kernel. If it does not, that entry is rejected and the problem falls back
to normal heuristic selection.

Validation is per entry, so upgrading hipBLASLt thins a tuning file rather than discarding it, and
only the shapes that failed need re-tuning. A row that carries a ``solution_name`` instead is
validated the same way. Files written by an older hipBLASLt carry no name at all, and those are used
only when the file's ``Git Version`` line matches the running build. A build made outside a git
checkout has no version to match, so it uses none of them.

``kernel_name`` names the compiled kernel, not the whole solution. The index still selects the
solution, including its GSU, WGM and StaggerU defaults, and several solutions can share one compiled
kernel, which is why the name is paired with the index rather than used on its own. What validation
guarantees is that the index resolves to the same compiled kernel as when the row was written. It
does not detect a rebuild that changes only that solution's defaults, whose row is used with the new
defaults, and it cannot find a kernel that moved to a different index: that row is rejected and the
shape falls back to heuristic selection.

Runtime tuning
==============

Instead of tuning offline with ``hipblaslt-bench``, hipBLASLt can benchmark candidate kernels itself
the first time an application runs a GEMM shape and remember the winner. It is the tuner
``hipblaslt-bench`` uses with ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE``, so the two pick winners the same way.

Runtime tuning is off until you ask for it, with two environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=<off|cache|tune>
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH=<file_name>

``tune`` benchmarks supported candidates for each shape it has not seen before, at that shape's first
matmul, and appends the winner to the cache file. ``cache`` only replays what the file already
contains, validating each entry as described above. ``off`` is the default and changes nothing.

Which kernel a matmul launches depends on whether it passes an algorithm. A call to
``hipblasLtMatmul`` with an explicit ``algo`` always launches that algorithm: the cache serves such a
caller through ``hipblasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic``, which returns the cached winner as its first
result. A call with ``algo=nullptr`` leaves the choice to the library and launches the cached entry
when there is a usable one. In ``tune`` mode the call that benchmarks a shape records the winner
either way, but only a call with ``algo=nullptr`` launches it straight away. A caller that queried the
heuristic before the shape was tuned, and reuses that algorithm, keeps launching it until it queries
the heuristic again.

``hipblaslt-bench`` writes its tuning file with the same tuner, so a cache file and an offline tuning
file hold the same rows and either can be read as the other. These rows include a schema version and
use the complete problem key, and every column of such a row is required: a row with a missing or
malformed value, including one a crash cut short, is ignored. Strides a problem does not use, such as
the batch strides of a single batch or the E strides of an epilogue without an E tensor, are recorded
as zero, and so is a scalar or vector scaling format when neither ``A`` nor ``B`` is scaled, so a
problem matches its own entry whether it arrives through the C API or the C++ extension. Rows without
a schema version, written by an older ``hipblaslt-bench`` or by hand, retain the historical matching
behavior: they distinguish transpose, shape and the principal datatypes, but not leading dimensions,
batch strides, epilogue details or device identity. Do not put problems that differ only in one of
those omitted fields in such a file.

``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH`` and ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE`` are mutually exclusive. With a
tuning mode set, only the cache is consulted and the override file is ignored.

Tuning is serialised within a process. A thread that meets an untuned shape while another thread is
tuning waits for it, so every shape ``tune`` mode meets is tuned, whatever the thread timing. Work
that other threads or processes run on the same GPU during a search still shares the device with it
and can shift the timings, so tune in a run whose GPU is otherwise quiet.

A process running in a secure execution context (set-user-ID, set-group-ID, or another
credential-changing exec such as file capabilities) ignores every ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_*`` variable,
so tuning stays off in it.

Only one process at a time may write a given cache file. Nothing coordinates separate processes, so
the ranks of a multi-process job such as MPI would each benchmark the same shapes and append to the
same file unsynchronised. Tune once in a single-rank warm-up run, then start the job with
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=cache``, which only reads:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH=tuning.txt
   HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=tune ./your_application          # one rank, once
   mpirun -n 8 env HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=cache ./your_application

A typical run writes the cache once and reuses it afterwards:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH=tuning.txt
   HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=tune ./your_application    # benchmark and record
   HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE=cache ./your_application   # replay only

The fastest measured candidate wins outright, with no minimum improvement over the default choice,
matching how ``hipblaslt-bench`` selects. The benchmarking effort can be adjusted:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ALL_KERNELS=<0|1>            (Default value is: 1)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MAX_CANDIDATES=<value>       (Default value is: 128)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_COLD_ITERS=<value>           (Default value is: 1000)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_HOT_ITERS=<value>            (Default value is: 1000)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ROTATING_MB=<value>          (Default value is: 512)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FLUSH_ICACHE=<0|1>           (Default value is: 1)
   export HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE=<value>  (Default value is: 300000, five minutes)

Each candidate is measured the way ``hipblaslt-bench`` measures one: ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_COLD_ITERS``
untimed launches, then ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_HOT_ITERS`` launches timed as a single span and reported as
the per-launch mean. Every candidate gets the full measurement, so there is no cheap ranking round
that could discard the real winner before it has been timed properly.

Candidates are measured against rotating copies of the tensors, so that successive launches do not
read and write the same cache lines. Without this every candidate is timed with its inputs already
resident, which is not how a production GEMM runs and which measurably changes which kernel appears
fastest. ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ROTATING_MB`` is the memory the rotation may use, and 0 disables it.

Rotation is declined for problems whose buffer sizes cannot be established from the problem
description alone, such as broadcast inputs with a zero batch stride and swizzled ``A`` or ``B``.
Those shapes are still tuned, just with their inputs cache-resident. Very small problems rotate over
fewer blocks than the memory budget would allow, since each block costs setup work per candidate.

The instruction cache is invalidated between timed launches, the same way and with the same kernel
the bench client uses, so a candidate is not timed with its own code already resident. It costs
roughly 5% of tuning time and measurably improves agreement with ``hipblaslt-bench``.
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FLUSH_ICACHE=0`` turns it off. The per-flush cost is measured once per device and
subtracted, so the recorded time stays the GEMM time.

Where a shape's leading kernels are separated by more than measurement noise, this is enough to make
tuning land on the same kernel run after run. Where they are within a couple of percent of each
other, the choice stays unstable and tuning may pick a kernel marginally slower than the heuristic
default; that is a property of the measurement, not of the cache, and ``hipblaslt-bench`` behaves the
same way on those shapes.

By default every kernel that can run the problem is measured, not just the ones the selection
heuristic ranks highest, because the fastest kernel is not always inside that ranked prefix. Setting
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ALL_KERNELS`` to 0 restricts the search to the top ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MAX_CANDIDATES``
ranked kernels instead, which is faster but can miss the best one.

Tuning one shape this thoroughly takes time. An exhaustive search over several hundred candidates
takes minutes, and it is paid once per shape in the first process that runs with ``tune``.
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE`` puts a wall-clock ceiling on one shape, covering enumeration
and setup as well as the timed measurements. It defaults to five minutes, so that a first matmul
cannot block a live application indefinitely, and 0 removes the ceiling entirely.

A search the ceiling cuts short still records its best candidate, marked incomplete. Candidates are
not measured in order of expected performance, so the best of a truncated prefix is usually not the
shape's best kernel. It is never worse than not tuning at all, though: the kernel the call would
otherwise launch is put at the front of the candidate list and measured first, and a truncated search
is recorded only when that kernel was measured, so the recorded winner is at least as fast as what
the call would have run untuned. Recording it means a shape too large to finish gets some of the
benefit immediately rather than none.

An incomplete entry is replayed like any other. What the marking buys is that tune mode revisits the
shape when a run comes along that can finish the search, and replaces the row, so a partial answer
never becomes permanent. To finish such a shape, raise or clear
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE`` and run it in tune mode again; as a rough guide a
2048x1024x2048 FP16 shape takes about 146 seconds on MI300X, and the cost grows with the problem.

Each row records the ceiling it was written under and the search that produced it: whether every
kernel or a ranked prefix was searched and how long that prefix was, the workspace limit, the
iteration counts, and whether the flush and rotation were on. A finished row is final only for a run
that would search no more than it did, so widening the search, for example from a ranked prefix to
every kernel, to a larger workspace, or to more iterations, tunes the shape again, while narrowing it
does not. An incomplete row is benchmarked again when the current ceiling beats the one it was
written under, with 0 beating every finite one, or when the search differs from the one that produced
it. Re-running the same workload with the same settings therefore costs nothing: the search would
measure the same candidates and stop in the same place, so it is not repeated and no second row is
appended. Within a single process a shape is benchmarked at most once in any case, including when an
attempt fails after ``tuning-start``. Rows written before these columns existed count as finished
searches.

Use the ceiling to bound how long tuning may run, not as a way to tune faster; to tune faster, reduce
the candidate list or the iteration counts.

The ceiling is checked between candidates, since a batch of launches already submitted cannot be
recalled. One candidate may therefore overrun it by as much as its own measurement takes. A search
that measures every candidate is kept however long it took, because a complete search gives the right
answer regardless of its duration.

The time ``hipblaslt-bench`` prints for a kernel is its own benchmark, separate from the tuner's
measurement, so the two can disagree between kernels that are within noise of each other. The tuner
caps how many rotation blocks it uses, leaves the scale vectors and a forward bias unrotated, and
always times with HIP events; ``hipblaslt-bench`` times with HIP events only with
``--use_gpu_timer`` and otherwise uses a synchronized CPU timer. Treat ``hipblaslt-bench``'s benchmark
as the reference when a shape matters enough to check by hand.

Benchmarking never writes to your buffers. Candidates run against memory the library allocates for
the purpose, and only the winner runs on the real output.

Reading the tuning output
-------------------------

Because the first call on a new shape can block for minutes, ``cache`` and ``tune`` mode report what
they are doing without needing any logging variable. A first ``tune`` run looks like this:

.. code-block:: none

   tuning-cache: mode=tune path=tuning.txt load=not-found loaded=0
   tuning-cache: tuning-start m=2048 n=1024 k=2048 batch=1 trans=TN types=f16_r/f16_r; this call will block until it finishes
   tuning-cache: tuning-done winner=247670 elapsed=145.7s persisted=yes
   tuning-cache: summary shapes=1 matched=1 fellback=0 tuned=1 invalidated=0

Replaying that cache prints only the first and last lines, since a cache hit says nothing per call:

.. code-block:: none

   tuning-cache: mode=cache path=tuning.txt load=ok loaded=1
   tuning-cache: summary shapes=1 matched=1 fellback=0 tuned=0 invalidated=0

``load`` is ``ok``, ``not-found``, ``read-error`` or ``no-path``, the last meaning
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH`` is unset and tuning does nothing.

The summary is how you confirm a deployed cache is actually being used. ``shapes`` counts distinct
problems the process looked up, not calls, so it stays comparable with ``loaded``. ``matched`` is how
many of them a cache entry served and ``fellback`` how many fell through to default selection; those
are the shapes still worth tuning. ``tuned`` counts distinct shapes this run benchmarked, whether or
not their winners reached the file; ``persisted`` on each ``tuning-done`` line is what tells you that.
``invalidated`` counts entries rejected because a rebuild moved the kernel they named. The summary is
written as the process exits normally, so a run that is killed or aborts does not produce one, and it
is left out entirely when a process loaded no entries and looked nothing up.

The output is bounded. A shape that cannot be tuned reports its reason once rather than once per
call, and shapes are announced at most once each. A shape declined for one call can still be tuned
on a later one, and that tune is reported:

.. code-block:: none

   tuning-cache: tuning-skipped in-place C==D with nonzero beta cannot be measured without mutating its input; using default selection

``tuning-partial`` in place of ``tuning-done`` means the budget stopped the search and its best
candidate was recorded as incomplete. ``tuning-skipped`` means the tuner understood the problem and
declined it, which is expected for some shapes forever. ``tuning-fallback`` means an attempt failed and is worth investigating; an
attempt that failed after ``tuning-start`` is not retried in the same process.

Setting ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL=4`` keeps all of the above, timestamps it like the rest of the library
log, and adds per-problem cache hit, miss and invalidation lines, the scratch and candidate setup,
a progress heartbeat every ten seconds during a long search, and the winner's measured time against
the baseline. At that level nothing is collapsed, so every attempt is reported. See
:ref:`environment-variables` for where each of these is written.

Limitations
-----------

* Tuning happens on the C API execution path. Callers of the C++ extension API can replay a cache but
  do not tune.
* Grouped GEMM is not served from the cache, and neither is a pointer-array batch called with
  ``algo=nullptr``. Grouped GEMM, pointer-array batch, RocRoller and HIP graph capture are excluded
  from tuning.
* An uncached in-place problem where ``C`` and ``D`` alias and ``beta`` is nonzero runs with normal
  selection instead of being tuned. Repeated benchmark launches would otherwise overwrite and reuse C
  rather than measuring the caller's input.
* One process should write a given cache file at a time. Multi-process jobs should tune in a
  single-rank warm-up and then run in ``cache`` mode; see above.
* ``alpha``, ``beta`` and whether ``C`` and ``D`` alias are not part of the lookup key, so an entry
  tuned at one value of ``beta`` can serve a caller using another.
* An explicit ``algo`` passed to ``hipblasLtMatmul`` always launches as given. A caller that reuses an
  algorithm it queried before its shape was tuned does not pick up the winner until it queries the
  heuristic again.
