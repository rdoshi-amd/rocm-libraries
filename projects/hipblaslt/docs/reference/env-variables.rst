hipBLASLt environment variables
********************************************************************

This section describes the important hipBLASLt environment variables,
which are grouped by functionality.

Logging and debugging
=====================

The logging and debugging environment variables for hipBLASLt are collected in the following table.
For more information, see :doc:`Use logging and heuristics <../how-to/use-logging-heuristics>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL``
        | Controls the verbosity level of hipBLASLt logging output.
        | Levels are cumulative: each one also enables the levels below it.
      - | 0: Off (logging disabled, default)
        | 1: Error (only errors are logged)
        | 2: Trace (API calls with kernel launches log parameters)

        | 5: API trace (detailed API call parameters)

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK``
        | Controls logging output using bit mask flags (can be combined).
        | Consulted only when ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL`` is unset.
      - | 0: Off
        | 1: Error
        | 2: Trace
        | 4: Hints

        | 16: API trace
        | 32: Bench
        | 64: Profile
        | 128: Extended profile

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_FILE``
        | Specifies path to logging file. Can contain ``%i`` for process ID replacement.
        | Has no effect unless a level or mask has enabled logging.
      - | Path to log file (for example, ``logfile_%i.log``)
        | If not defined: log messages printed to stderr

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_MARKER``
        | Enables marker trace for ROCProfiler profiling.
      - | 0 or unset: Disable marker trace
        | 1: Enable marker trace


Offline tuning
===============

The offline tuning environment variables for hipBLASLt are collected in the following table.
For more information, see :doc:`Use hipBLASLt offline tuning <../how-to/how-to-use-hipblaslt-offline-tuning>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE``
        | Makes ``hipblaslt-bench`` tune each problem it runs with hipBLASLt's tune mode and append the winner to this file.
      - | Path to tuning file (for example, ``tuning.txt``)
        | Read back with ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE`` or ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH``

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE``
        | Specifies file to load tuning results and override default kernel selection.
      - | Path to tuning file (for example, ``tuning.txt``)
        | Loads previously saved optimal kernel choices

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_USER_MAX_WORKSPACE``
        | Sets maximum workspace size constraint during tuning stage.
      - | Integer value in bytes (default: 128 * 1024 * 1024)
        | Limits workspace size for solution selection

Runtime tuning
==============

Runtime tuning is opt-in and off by default. ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE`` and
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH`` are read the first time they are needed in a process, so set them
before the first hipBLASLt call. The scratch cap is read on the first scratch allocation. A process
running in a secure execution context (set-user-ID, set-group-ID, or another credential-changing exec
such as file capabilities) ignores every variable in this section, so tuning stays off. For more
information, see :doc:`Use hipBLASLt offline tuning <../how-to/how-to-use-hipblaslt-offline-tuning>`.

``online`` mode never blocks a call. It spends its measurements on the caller's own dispatches:
for the first ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_COLD_ITERS`` visits of a problem it launches the ranked first
choice untouched, then dispatches each of the top ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MAX_CANDIDATES`` in turn
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_HOT_ITERS`` times, timing each with a HIP event pair that is read back on a
later visit to the same problem, and pins the fastest for every call after that. It only does so
where the library chooses the kernel, so an explicitly supplied algorithm is never overridden, and
it leaves a shape the cache file already serves to the cache.

``cache`` and ``tune`` mode write a few notices without any logging variable, because tuning can
block the first call on a new shape for minutes and a silent pause looks like a hang. The notices are
bounded: one line naming the mode and what loaded, one start and one result per shape that is
actually tuned, and one closing summary. Replaying a cache adds no output per call. Where the notices
go depends on logging:

* No level or mask: stderr. ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_FILE`` alone does not open a log file.
* ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL`` 1 to 3, or a mask without the info bit: the stream logging already opened,
  including ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_FILE``.
* ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL=4`` or higher, or ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK`` including ``8``: the same stream,
  formatted like every other log line, plus a cache hit, miss or invalidation line once per problem,
  the scratch and candidate setup, a progress heartbeat, and measurement results.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE``
        | Selects runtime tuning behavior.
      - | ``off``: Disable runtime tuning (default)
        | ``cache``: Replay valid entries from the cache file
        | ``tune``: Benchmark uncached supported problems and append winners
        | ``online``: Time top ranked candidates on live calls and pin the winner

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH``
        | Specifies the runtime cache file.
      - | Path to a tuning file
        | Required for ``cache``, ``tune``, and ``online`` modes

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ALL_KERNELS``
        | Selects exhaustive or ranked-prefix candidate enumeration.
        | Not read in ``online`` mode, which always uses a ranked prefix.
      - | 1: Enumerate every candidate (default)
        | 0: Use a ranked prefix

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MAX_CANDIDATES``
        | Limits the ranked prefix when exhaustive enumeration is disabled.
      - | Positive integer (``tune`` default: 128, ``online`` default: 5)
        | Below 2 switches ``online`` mode off

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_COLD_ITERS``
        | Sets untimed warm-up launches per candidate in ``tune`` mode, and untimed first visits
          per problem in ``online`` mode.
      - | Non-negative integer (``tune`` default: 1000, ``online`` default: 32)
        | 0 disables warm-up

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_HOT_ITERS``
        | Sets timed launches per candidate.

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ROTATING_MB``
        | Sets the target rotating-buffer footprint.
        | Not read in ``online`` mode, which measures the caller's own buffers.
      - | MiB (default: 512)
        | 0 disables rotation

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FLUSH_ICACHE``
        | Invalidates the instruction cache between timed launches, matching the bench client.
        | Not read in ``online`` mode, which does not launch between the caller's own dispatches.
      - | 1: Flush (default); costs about 5% of tuning time
        | 0: Do not flush; winners become less reproducible

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_BUDGET_MS_PER_SHAPE``
        | Sets a soft wall-clock limit on one shape's search, checked between candidates.
        | Not read in ``online`` mode, which never blocks a call and so has no stall to bound.
      - | Milliseconds (default: 300000, five minutes; 0 is unlimited)
        | A truncated search records its best candidate as incomplete
        | A single candidate can overrun the limit

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_SCRATCH_MAX_BYTES``
        | Caps library-owned tuning scratch per device.
        | Not read in ``online`` mode, which owns no scratch.
      - | Bytes (default: 1 GiB)

Origami with Stream-K configuration
===================================

The Origami with Stream-K configuration environment variables for hipBLASLt are collected in the following table.
These variables apply to all GEMMs in an application.
For more information, see :doc:`Use Stream-K with hipBLASLt <../how-to/how-to-use-streamk>`.

The ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_*`` launch controls apply to persistent kernels, including Stream-K and persistent DataParallel.
The legacy aliases listed below remain supported. When both names are set, the preferred name takes precedence,
even if its value is invalid; it does not fall back to the legacy value.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``TENSILE_SOLUTION_SELECTION_METHOD``
        | Controls hipBLASLt kernel selection strategy for GEMM operations.
      - | 0: Default (standard tuned libraries, no Stream-K)
        | 2: Origami with Stream-K (enables Origami solution selection for consistent performance)
        | This variable has no effect on the AMD Instinct™ MI350 series. Stream-K is always used.

    * - | ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_DYNAMIC_GRID``
        | Legacy alias: ``TENSILE_STREAMK_DYNAMIC_GRID``.
        | Controls persistent grid size selection behavior.
      - | 0: Disable dynamic grid (use all available compute units)
        | 1: Only reduce compute units for small problems to the number of output tiles when ``num_tiles < CU count``
        | 2: Also reduce compute units for large sizes to improve the data-parallel portion and reduce power
        | 3: Analytically predict the best grid size by weighing the cost of the fix-up step and the cost of processing MACs 
        | 4: The Stream-K algorithm behaves like data parallel (Launch WGs =  number of CUs)
        | 5: The Stream-K algorithm uses the Origami ``select_best_grid_size`` function
        | 6: Default (automatically pick the optimal workgroup count)

    * - | ``TENSILE_GRIDBASED_KDTREE``
        | Force-enables the k-d tree index on grid-based solution-selection tables, which are otherwise scanned linearly.
        | Enable-only: it can switch the index on for tables that do not ask for it, but it can never switch it off. A table that declares ``UseKdTree: true`` in its library-logic file already uses the index with this variable unset, and no value of this variable changes that.
        | Affects which kernel is selected, not the result it computes.
      - | Unset or 0: Each grid-based table uses the ``UseKdTree`` value declared in its library-logic file. Tables that do not declare it are scanned linearly.
        | Non-zero: Enable the index for every grid-based table, in addition to those already declaring ``UseKdTree: true``.
        | To disable the index for a table that declares ``UseKdTree: true``, remove the key (or set it to ``false``) in that table's library-logic file and rebuild the device library. This cannot be done at runtime.

    * - | ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_FIXED_GRID``
        | Legacy alias: ``TENSILE_STREAMK_FIXED_GRID``.
        | Overrides the default persistent grid size, subject to the kernel's launch limits.
      - | Positive integer specifying the number of workgroups
        | Default: 0 (no override)
        | Example: 64 (limits GEMM kernels to 64 workgroups)

    * - | ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_MAX_CUS``
        | Legacy alias: ``TENSILE_STREAMK_MAX_CUS``.
        | Sets the compute-unit budget used for persistent grid sizing.
      - | Positive integer specifying the compute-unit budget
        | Example: 32
        | Default: 0 (all available compute units)

    * - | ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_GRID_MULTIPLIER``
        | Legacy alias: ``TENSILE_STREAMK_GRID_MULTIPLIER``.
        | Multiplies the compute-unit count to size the persistent grid when dynamic grid selection and the CU cap are disabled and no fixed grid is set.
        | The resulting grid remains subject to the kernel's launch limits.
      - | Integer greater than 1 to enable multiplication
        | Default: 1

    * - | ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_DYNAMIC_WGM``
        | Legacy alias: ``TENSILE_STREAMK_DYNAMIC_WGM``.
        | Retained for compatibility; currently has no effect on workgroup mapping.
      - | Default: 0

    * - | ``TENSILE_PERSISTENT_HYBRID_FORCE_MODE``
        | Legacy alias: ``TENSILE_STREAMK5_FORCE_MODE``.
        | Debug override for the mode of an already selected Hybrid kernel; does not select the kernel family.
      - | -1: Respect the normal assignment policy (default)
        | 0: Force static assignment
        | 1: Force dynamic work-queue assignment
        | Malformed or out-of-range values are ignored.
