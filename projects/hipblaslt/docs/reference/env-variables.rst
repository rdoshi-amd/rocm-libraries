********************************************************************

This section describes the important hipBLASLt environment variables,
which are grouped by functionality.

Logging and debugging
=====================

The logging and debugging environment variables for hipBLASLt are collected in the following table.
For more information, see :doc:`Use logging and heuristics <../how-to/use-logging-heuristics>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL``
        | Controls the verbosity level of hipBLASLt logging output.
        | Levels are cumulative: each one also enables the levels below it.
      - | 0: Off (logging disabled, default)
        | 1: Error (only errors are logged)
        | 2: Trace (API calls with kernel launches log parameters)
        | 3: Hints (performance improvement suggestions)
        | 4: Info (general library execution information)
        | 5: API trace (detailed API call parameters)

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK``
        | Controls logging output using bit mask flags (can be combined).
        | Consulted only when ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL`` is unset.
      - | 0: Off
        | 1: Error
        | 2: Trace
        | 4: Hints
        | 8: Info
        | 16: API trace
        | 32: Bench
        | 64: Profile
        | 128: Extended profile

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_FILE``
        | Specifies path to logging file. Can contain ``%i`` for process ID replacement.
        | Has no effect unless a level or mask has enabled logging.
      - | Path to log file (for example, ``logfile_%i.log``)
        | If not defined: log messages printed to stderr

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_MARKER``
        | Enables marker trace for ROCProfiler profiling.
      - | 0 or unset: Disable marker trace
        | 1: Enable marker trace


Offline tuning
===============

The offline tuning environment variables for hipBLASLt are collected in the following table.
For more information, see :doc:`Use hipBLASLt offline tuning <../how-to/how-to-use-hipblaslt-offline-tuning>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FILE``
        | Makes ``hipblaslt-bench`` tune each problem it runs with hipBLASLt's tune mode and append the winner to this file.
      - | Path to tuning file (for example, ``tuning.txt``)
        | Read back with ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE`` or ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH``

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_OVERRIDE_FILE``
        | Specifies file to load tuning results and override default kernel selection.
      - | Path to tuning file (for example, ``tuning.txt``)
        | Loads previously saved optimal kernel choices

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_USER_MAX_WORKSPACE``
        | Sets maximum workspace size constraint during tuning stage.
      - | Integer value in bytes (default: 128 * 1024 * 1024)
        | Limits workspace size for solution selection

Runtime tuning
==============

Runtime tuning is opt-in and off by default. ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE`` and
``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH`` are read the first time they are needed in a process, so set them
before the first hipBLASLt call. The scratch cap is read on the first scratch allocation. A process
running in a secure execution context (set-user-ID, set-group-ID, or another credential-changing exec
such as file capabilities) ignores every variable in this section, so tuning stays off. For more
information, see :doc:`Use hipBLASLt offline tuning <../how-to/how-to-use-hipblaslt-offline-tuning>`.

``cache`` and ``tune`` mode write a few notices without any logging variable, because tuning can
block the first call on a new shape for minutes and a silent pause looks like a hang. The notices are
bounded: one line naming the mode and what loaded, one start and one result per shape that is
actually tuned, and one closing summary. Replaying a cache adds no output per call. Where the notices
go depends on logging:

* No level or mask: stderr. ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_FILE`` alone does not open a log file.
* ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL`` 1 to 3, or a mask without the info bit: the stream logging already opened,
  including ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_FILE``.
* ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_LEVEL=4`` or higher, or ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK`` including ``8``: the same stream,
  formatted like every other log line, plus a cache hit, miss or invalidation line once per problem,
  the scratch and candidate setup, a progress heartbeat, and measurement results.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_MODE``
        | Selects runtime tuning behavior.
      - | ``off``: Disable runtime tuning (default)

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_CACHE_PATH``
        | Specifies the runtime cache file.

        | Required for ``cache`` and ``tune`` modes

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_ALL_KERNELS``
        | Selects exhaustive or ranked-prefix candidate enumeration.

        | Sets untimed warm-up launches per candidate.
      - | Non-negative integer (default: 1000)

    * - | ``HIPBLASLT_TUNING_FLUSH_ICACHE``
        | Invalidates the instruction cache between timed launches, matching the bench client.
      - | 1: Flush (default); costs about 5% of tuning time
        | 0: Do not flush; winners become less reproducible

        | Sets a soft wall-clock limit on one shape's search, checked between candidates.
      - | Milliseconds (default: 300000, five minutes; 0 is unlimited)
        | A truncated search records its best candidate as incomplete
        | A single candidate can overrun the limit

Origami with Stream-K configuration
===================================

The Origami with Stream-K configuration environment variables for hipBLASLt are collected in the following table.
These variables apply to all GEMMs in an application.
For more information, see :doc:`Use Stream-K with hipBLASLt <../how-to/how-to-use-streamk>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``TENSILE_SOLUTION_SELECTION_METHOD``
        | Controls hipBLASLt kernel selection strategy for GEMM operations.
      - | 0: Default (standard tuned libraries, no Stream-K)
        | 2: Origami with Stream-K (enables Origami solution selection for consistent performance)
        | This variable has no effect on the AMD Instinct™ MI350 series. Stream-K is always used.

    * - | ``TENSILE_STREAMK_DYNAMIC_GRID``
        | Controls Stream-K dynamic grid size selection behavior.
      - | 0: Disable dynamic grid (use all available compute units)
        | 1: Only reduce compute units for small problems to the number of output tiles when ``num_tiles < CU count``
        | 2: Also reduce compute units for large sizes to improve the data-parallel portion and reduce power
        | 3: Analytically predict the best grid size by weighing the cost of the fix-up step and the cost of processing MACs 
        | 4: The Stream-K algorithm behaves like data parallel (Launch WGs =  number of CUs)
        | 5: The Stream-K algorithm uses the Origami ``select_best_grid_size`` function
        | 6: Default (automatically pick the optimal workgroup count)

    * - | ``TENSILE_STREAMK_FIXED_GRID``
        | Overrides default grid size with specified number of workgroups for Stream-K kernels.
      - | Integer value specifying number of workgroups
        | Example: 64 (limits GEMM kernels to 64 workgroups)

    * - | ``TENSILE_STREAMK_MAX_CUS``
        | Sets maximum number of compute units for Stream-K kernels.
      - | Integer value specifying maximum compute units
        | Example: 32 (limits GEMM kernels to 32 compute units)
        | Default: All available compute units
