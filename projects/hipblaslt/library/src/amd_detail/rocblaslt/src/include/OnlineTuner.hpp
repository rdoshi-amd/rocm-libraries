 * @brief Explore-then-cache kernel selection on top of the Origami ranking.
 *
 * The first topK() * repeats() times a problem is seen, each of the top-K
 * ranked candidates is dispatched in turn and timed on the GPU; once every
 * candidate has been sampled the measured winner is pinned for every later
 * call with that problem. statistic() decides how a candidate's repeats are
 * reduced to the one score the winner is chosen on.
 *
 * Timing is deferred-read. beginMeasurement() hands back an event pair for the
 * caller to wrap the launch with, and the elapsed time is only read on a later
 * visit to the same problem, once hipEventQuery() reports the stop event
 * complete. A whole exploration may be outstanding at once, so a caller that
 * enqueues the same problem back to back without synchronising still explores
 * at dispatch rate rather than at queue-drain rate. No entry point here ever
 * waits on the GPU.
 *
 * Every entry point is a branch on a member flag when
 * HIPBLASLT_ORIGAMI_ONLINE_TUNE_TOP_K is unset, so the feature costs nothing
 * when it is off.
