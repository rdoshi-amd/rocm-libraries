# TensileLite

TensileLite is hipBLASLt's Python generator, logic validator, and tuning
workflow. Released Python wheels validate against the selected ROCm
installation. The runtime selects the first applicable installation model:

- **TheRock CI:** the command-scoped `THEROCK_PACKAGE_VERSION` is the full
  ROCm publication identity, and the graph-prepared `PATH` supplies compiler
  and toolchain commands.
- **Python SDK packages:** the active `rocm_sdk_core.__version__` is the full
  ROCm publication identity. Interpreter script directories supply compiler
  and toolchain commands.
- **Conventional prefix:** an explicitly selected prefix from `ROCM_PATH`,
  `/opt/rocm`, or a ROCm tool discovered on `PATH` supplies root-relative
  tools. Its `.info/version` is authoritative only for the base `A.B.C`
  compatibility line, so it cannot distinguish nightly, RC, or CI
  publications on that line.

The models do not borrow paths from each other. `rocisa` is a separately
prepared Python dependency; TensileLite requires it to be importable but does
not prescribe its ABI or native-artifact layout.

Import validates the wheel's ROCm tag against the selected installation: full
publication identity for TheRock CI and Python SDK packages, and the base
compatibility version for a conventional prefix. Python SDK support is active
whenever `rocm_sdk_core` is installed; it is not gated by a separate switch.

## Supported interface

```bash
tensilelite benchmark-cluster --help
tensilelite create-library --help
tensilelite generate-summations --help
tensilelite logic --help
tensilelite logic-to-yaml --help
tensilelite merge-library --help
tensilelite retune-library --help
tensilelite run --help
tensilelite update-library --help

# Equivalent module form
python -m tensilelite --help
```

The default wheel exposes `import tensilelite`; it does not provide the legacy
`Tensile` namespace or `Tensile/bin` launchers. An optional
`tensilelite-tensile-compat` wheel supplies deprecated command aliases only.


## Released installation

For a conventional ROCm prefix, use the wheel index delivered with the target
release and select that same prefix:

```bash
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm
python -m pip install --index-url <rocm-wheel-index> tensilelite
python -c 'import tensilelite, rocisa; print(tensilelite.__version__)'
```

With TheRock's Python SDK, install the matching core, libraries, and device
payload in the same Python environment before installing TensileLite. TensileLite
uses the core package's full Python distribution version and its interpreter's
tool trampolines; it does not require `rocm[devel]` or a synthetic ROCm prefix:

```bash
python -m pip install --index-url <rocm-wheel-index> \
  'rocm[libraries,device-<target>]'
python -m pip install --index-url <rocm-wheel-index> tensilelite
```

Import fails when the wheel and selected ROCm release differ. The client is
resolved and validated only when a benchmark or validation workflow requests
its path. A configured client binding always wins; otherwise the lookup is
limited to the selected installation's executable paths: the graph-prepared
`PATH` for TheRock CI, interpreter script directories for Python SDK packages,
and `<prefix>/bin` plus `<prefix>/lib/llvm/bin` for a conventional prefix. If
no compatible `tensilelite-client` is available there, the requesting workflow
reports an error rather than searching broadly on `PATH`.

Optional runtime capabilities remain available as extras:

```bash
python -m pip install 'tensilelite[profile]'     # yappi profiling
python -m pip install 'tensilelite[hip-query]'   # hip-python GPU queries
python -m pip install 'tensilelite[orjson]'      # preferred JSON accelerator
python -m pip install 'tensilelite[ujson]'
python -m pip install 'tensilelite[simplejson]'
```

Only one JSON extra is needed. If multiple backends are installed, TensileLite
prefers orjson, then ujson, then simplejson, and finally the Python standard
library.

## Source development

From a Linux ROCm development environment, the one-command setup installs the
shared development requirements and editable rocisa, builds/stages
`tensilelite-client`, and installs TensileLite editably into the active Python
environment:

```bash
cd rocm-libraries/projects/hipblaslt/tensilelite
invoke install --gpu-targets gfx942
```

The editable installation records the built client's absolute path in the
current user's keyed `~/.tensilelite/bindings/` registry. Python source edits
are immediately visible; rerun `invoke build-client` after client source or
CMake changes.

Each step remains available independently. A manual source install may bind any
existing client executable:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev-common.txt
invoke build-client --gpu-targets gfx942

TENSILELITE_ROCM_VERSION="$(<"${ROCM_PATH:-/opt/rocm}/.info/version")" \
  python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .
python -m tensilelite_configure_client \
  --client "$PWD/build_tmp/tensilelite/client/tensilelite-client"


# Remove only this installation's development binding.
python -m tensilelite_configure_client --reset
```

The client value must be an absolute executable whose exact `--version`
matches the installed distribution. A configured binding is exclusive: a
broken configured path never falls back to the production client. Configuration
does not alter the wheel, and the client selection is frozen after its first
request in a process. Use a fresh process after changing or resetting a binding.


## Tests

Tox builds the client, configures the active editable installation, and uses the
selected real ROCm SDK before importing either Python package:

```bash
tox -e unit -- tensilelite/Tests/unit
tox -e py3 -- tensilelite/Tests -m common
tox -e coverage-unit
tox -e coverage
```

Useful variables:

- `TENSILELITE_TEST_ARCH`: architecture used for unit-test staging (default
  `gfx942`).
- `TENSILE_NUM_PYTEST_WORKERS`: pytest worker count (default `4`).
- `TENSILELITE_CLIENT_ARGS`: extra arguments forwarded to `invoke build-client`
  by full/coverage tox environments.

The optional affected-tests hook is installed with:

```bash
TENSILELITE_ROCM_VERSION="$(<"${ROCM_PATH:-/opt/rocm}/.info/version")" uv sync
invoke build-client --gpu-targets gfx942
invoke configure-client --build-dir build_tmp
uv run invoke precommit-install
```

`VERSION` and `tensilelite.GENERATOR_VERSION` identify the generator format and
must remain equal. The command above uses the selected SDK's ROCm publication
identity so the editable package and the client built by the hook agree.


## CMake integration

Device generation builds the canonical controlled-artifact wheel, installs it
into the single CMake-selected Python with `--force-reinstall --no-deps`, and
uses only the in-tree raw rocisa package through a command-scoped `PYTHONPATH`.
It does not resolve or bind `tensilelite-client`. Do not run two configurations
concurrently against one Python environment.

Device-generation builds require Python 3.10 and Python development headers;
stable-ABI rocisa builds require Python 3.12. A true host-only build does not
require TensileLite Python. Standalone Windows builds must set `ROCM_PATH` to
the SDK used for the build.

Relevant options:

- `TENSILELITE_ENABLE_HOST`
- `TENSILELITE_ENABLE_CLIENT`
- `TENSILELITE_BUILD_TESTING`
- `ROCISA_BUILD_PYTHON` (rocisa-only root configuration)
- `GPU_TARGETS`
