"""TDM LDS rings (NLDSBuffer): PrefetchGlobalRead[A/B] >= 3 on the TDM path.

A side prefetching S >= 3 stages rotates its TDM writes through S LDS slots, so the N of
NLDSBuffer is a prefetch depth. That is not TDMPlusLdsBuf (3LDSB), which adds a third LDS
buffer at PGR2 and still keeps two stages in flight; that switch and its code paths are
not shared with the ring.

S has no fixed cap; MaxLDS and the per-wave in-flight bound limit it. The bound covers
every TDM configuration: gfx1250 B0 and gfx1251 TDM can deadlock with more than
TDM_INFLIGHT_PER_WAVE_LIMIT operations outstanding from one wave.
