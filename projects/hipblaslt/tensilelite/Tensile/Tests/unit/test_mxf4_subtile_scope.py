"""The scope gate for the MXF4 subtile optimizations.

``isMxf4SubtilePath`` and the tile predicates layered on it decide, for every
kernel in the library, whether the fused post-loop store and the partitioned
block schedule are built. Getting the gate wrong in the permissive direction
silently reshapes the epilogue of kernels that were never measured with it, and
that failure mode is invisible in a test that only drives MXF4 configs.

These are pure-predicate tests: no emit, no GPU, no toolchain.
