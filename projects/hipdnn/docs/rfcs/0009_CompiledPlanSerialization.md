## Summary

hipDNN can serialize a compiled execution plan to bytes, deserialize those bytes later, and execute
the restored plan with UID-based variant packs. The feature is intentionally plan-only: it restores
the executable plan state, not the frontend operation graph.

The serialized object has two layers:

1. A hipDNN-owned FlatBuffer envelope rooted at `SerializedExecutionPlan`.
2. An opaque plugin-owned byte payload.

hipDNN owns routing metadata and tensor UID metadata. Plugins own their internal serialization
format. hipDNN never inspects or constrains the plugin payload beyond copying bytes into and out of
the envelope.

## User Flow

Build and serialize a compiled plan:

```cpp
graph.validate();
graph.build_operation_graph(handle);
graph.create_execution_plans();
graph.check_support();
graph.build_plans();

std::vector<uint8_t> compiledPlan;
graph.serialize_compiled_plan(compiledPlan);
```

Deserialize and execute:

```cpp
hipdnn_frontend::graph::Graph restored;
restored.deserialize_compiled_plan(handle, compiledPlan);
restored.execute(handle, variantPack, workspace);
```

The restored `Graph` contains only an execution plan descriptor. APIs that depend on source graph
nodes, engine configs, or graph mutation should not be assumed to work after compiled-plan
deserialization.

## Frontend API

`hipdnn_frontend::graph::Graph` exposes:

```cpp
Error serialize_compiled_plan(std::vector<uint8_t>& data) const;
std::pair<std::vector<uint8_t>, Error> to_compiled_plan_binary() const;

Error deserialize_compiled_plan(hipdnnHandle_t handle, const std::vector<uint8_t>& data);
Error from_compiled_plan_binary(hipdnnHandle_t handle, const std::vector<uint8_t>& data);
```

`serialize_compiled_plan()` requires a finalized execution plan. `deserialize_compiled_plan()`
creates a finalized backend execution plan descriptor, stores it in the frontend graph, clears graph
build descriptors, and leaves execution available through the normal UID variant-pack path.

## Backend API

The frontend calls these backend extension APIs:

```cpp
hipdnnStatus_t hipdnnBackendGetSerializedExecutionPlan_ext(
    hipdnnBackendDescriptor_t descriptor,
    size_t requestedByteSize,
    size_t* planByteSize,
    uint8_t* serializedPlan);

hipdnnStatus_t hipdnnBackendCreateAndDeserializeExecutionPlan_ext(
    hipdnnHandle_t handle,
    hipdnnBackendDescriptor_t* descriptor,
    const uint8_t* serializedPlan,
    size_t planByteSize);
```

Serialization follows the normal two-call size-query pattern. Deserialization uses the supplied
`hipdnnHandle_t` to find the engine plugin resource manager, restore the plugin execution context,
and return a finalized execution plan descriptor.

## Envelope Format

The hipDNN envelope is a FlatBuffer schema in `flatbuffers_sdk/schemas/execution_plan.fbs`:

```flatbuffers
namespace hipdnn_flatbuffers_sdk.data_objects;

table SerializedExecutionPlan {
    version: uint;
    engine_id: int64;
    workspace_size: int64;
    tensor_uids: [int64];
    plugin_payload: [ubyte];
}

root_type SerializedExecutionPlan;
```

Field ownership:

- `version`: hipDNN envelope version.
- `engine_id`: selected backend engine ID.
- `workspace_size`: workspace size reported for the compiled plan.
- `tensor_uids`: hipDNN-level tensor UID metadata needed for UID-based execution.
- `plugin_payload`: opaque plugin-specific execution context bytes.

There is deliberately no operation graph in the envelope. A backend may not use graph execution, and
plugins that need graph-derived data must store it in their own payload.

## Plugin API

Engine plugins may implement these optional C API entry points:

```cpp
hipdnnPluginStatus_t hipdnnEnginePluginSerializeExecutionContextWithEngineId(
    hipdnnEnginePluginHandle_t handle,
    int64_t engine_id,
    hipdnnEnginePluginExecutionContext_t execution_context,
    hipdnnPluginConstData_t* serialized_context);

hipdnnPluginStatus_t hipdnnEnginePluginDestroySerializedExecutionContext(
    hipdnnEnginePluginHandle_t handle,
    hipdnnPluginConstData_t* serialized_context);

hipdnnPluginStatus_t hipdnnEnginePluginCreateExecutionContextFromSerialized(
    hipdnnEnginePluginHandle_t handle,
    const hipdnnPluginConstData_t* serialized_context,
    hipdnnEnginePluginExecutionContext_t* execution_context);
```

These functions are optional. Plugins that do not export them still load normally, but compiled-plan
serialization returns `HIPDNN_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` for plans using those plugins. hipDNN uses the
hooks only when the plugin exports all three.

hipDNN passes `engine_id`, the ID of the engine that built the plan, to the save hook. For a plan
that hipDNN loaded from serialized bytes, `engine_id` is the engine ID that the envelope records.
hipDNN does not call the earlier save hook `hipdnnEnginePluginSerializeExecutionContext`. A plugin
that exports only that name does not support serialization.

The plugin payload contract is byte-level:

- The plugin allocates and owns `serialized_context` for the duration of the serialize call.
- hipDNN copies the bytes into `plugin_payload`.
- hipDNN calls the plugin destroy hook after copying.
- hipDNN passes the same bytes back during deserialization.
- Plugin payload versioning and compatibility are plugin-owned.

## Backend Object Model

`ExecutionPlanDescriptor` now supports two construction paths:

1. Normal build path: finalize from an `EngineConfigDescriptor`, graph, and plugin resource manager.
2. Deserialized path: finalize from `SerializedExecutionPlan` bytes and a restored plugin execution
   context.

The descriptor stores enough state to execute without `EngineConfig -> Engine -> Graph`:

- Engine ID.
- Workspace size.
- Tensor UIDs.
- Plugin resource manager.
- Plugin execution context wrapper.

Execution reads the engine ID and execution context directly from the execution plan descriptor.
This is what makes a graph-less restored plan executable.

## Fusilli Implementation

The fusilli provider implements the optional plugin hooks as the sample backend. Its
`plugin_payload` is fusilli-owned and starts with a small fusilli compatibility header:

```text
magic: "FUSPLAN\0"
format_major: uint16
format_minor: uint16
payload_kind: uint32
header_size: uint32
payload_bytes: uint8[]
```

The initial `payload_kind` stores the hipDNN graph FlatBuffer bytes needed to reconstruct and
compile a fusilli execution context. Fusilli rejects payloads with an unknown magic value, an
unsupported major format version, an unsupported payload kind, or an empty/malformed payload before
attempting graph import. This keeps the hipDNN envelope byte-level while giving fusilli an explicit
breaking-change boundary for future native compiled-artifact serialization.

The sample at
`dnn-providers/fusilli-provider/test/integration/matmul/serialized_matmul.cpp`:

1. Builds a simple matmul graph.
2. Builds the compiled execution plan.
3. Serializes the compiled plan.
4. Deserializes it into a fresh frontend `Graph`.
5. Executes with UID bindings.
6. Validates the output against the CPU reference.

This sample demonstrates the intended contract: the original graph performs compilation; the
restored graph owns only an executable compiled plan.

## hip-kernel-provider Ingestor Implementation

The hip-kernel-provider implements the three plugin hooks for its kernel ingestor engines. The
provider exports the hooks only when the build sets `HIPDNN_ENABLE_KERNEL_INGESTOR=ON`. The hooks
are in `dnn-providers/hip-kernel-provider/src/core/PluginSerialization.cpp`.

### Supported Engines

An ingestor engine supports serialization when each kernel in its descriptor set is a kpack code
object. The provider calculates this from the descriptor set. A supported engine reports the
behavior note `HIPDNN_BEHAVIOR_NOTE_SUPPORTS_EXECUTION_PLAN_SERIALIZATION`. The other engines of the
provider do not report this note.

The save hook uses `engine_id` to find the engine. The save hook refuses a plan when `engine_id` is
not an ingestor engine that the plugin handle loaded.

### Payload Layout

The `plugin_payload` starts with a 48-byte header. All header integers are little-endian.

```text
offset  size  field
0       4     marker: "HKIP"
4       2     format_major: uint16
6       2     format_minor: uint16
8       2     kind: uint16 (1 = single-kernel plan)
10      2     header_size: uint16
12      4     reserved: zero
16      32    body_sha256: SHA-256 of the body
```

The body starts at `header_size`. The body is a FlatBuffer with the file identifier `HKSP`. The
schema is `dnn-providers/hip-kernel-provider/src/engines/kernel_ingestor_engine/serialization/ingestor_plan.fbs`.
The body contains this data:

- The engine name. The hash of the engine name is the engine ID.
- The kernel descriptor ID.
- The workspace size in bytes.
- The UIDs of the runtime pass-by-value tensors.
- The dispatch data: the versioned dispatch name and the named, typed launch values.
- The kernel image: the source kind, the kernel symbol, the GPU target, the SHA-256 of the code
  object, the recorded argument signature, and the uncompressed code object.
- The provider version. The provider version is for diagnostics only.

The launch values are the inputs from which the dispatch handler calculates a launch. The payload
does not hold calculated grid sizes or kernel argument values.

### Versioning

The current format version is 1.0. A reader reads a payload when these conditions are true:

- The major version of the payload is equal to the major version of the reader.
- The minor version of the payload is not more than the minor version of the reader.

A new minor version only adds optional fields. All other changes need a new major version. The
provider version never controls a load. A reader accepts a header larger than 48 bytes when its size
is a multiple of 16.

### Load Checks

hipDNN uses the envelope engine ID to find the plugin. When no loaded plugin serves that engine ID,
hipDNN refuses the plan with `HIPDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`. The plugin does not run.

The load hook then does these checks in this order. The first check that fails stops the load.

1. The payload holds the fixed header fields (`INVALID_VALUE`).
2. The marker is `HKIP` (`INVALID_VALUE`).
3. The provider reads the format version (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
4. The plan kind is known (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
5. The header size is valid for the payload (`INVALID_VALUE`).
6. The body size is in the FlatBuffers limits (`INVALID_VALUE`).
7. The SHA-256 of the body is equal to the header value (`INVALID_VALUE`).
8. The FlatBuffers verifier accepts the body, and the body has the `HKSP` identifier
   (`INVALID_VALUE`).
9. The workspace size, the source kind, the kernel SHA-256 text and the launch values are valid
   (`INVALID_VALUE`).
10. The plan has no runtime pass-by-value tensors (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
11. The plugin handle loaded an ingestor engine with the saved engine name (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
12. The device of the handle can run the stored GPU target (`NOT_APPLICABLE`). A kpack target
    matches by prefix, as kpack archive entries do. Other source kinds need the exact target.
13. A dispatch handler is registered under the dispatch name (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
14. The recorded argument signature matches the arguments that the handler launches
    (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
15. The handler accepts the launch values (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).
16. The driver loads the code object on the device of the handle and finds the kernel symbol
    (`NOT_APPLICABLE`).

The load hook loads the code object. As a result, a code object that the driver refuses fails the
load, not the first execute. Another device loads its own module from the stored bytes at its first use.

### Statuses and Messages

The plugin uses two statuses for a refusal. Each status has one message prefix for a load and one
for a save.

| Cause | Plugin status | Load message prefix | Save message prefix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The data is damaged. | `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE` | `ingestor plan data is damaged: ` | `cannot save this plan: its kernel source does not match its descriptor: ` |
| The plan is valid, but the provider cannot save or load it here. | `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE` | `ingestor plan is valid but cannot be saved or loaded here: ` | `cannot save this plan here: ` |

hipDNN reports both plugin statuses as `HIPDNN_STATUS_PLUGIN_ERROR`. The hipDNN error message keeps
the text of the plugin. The prefix identifies the cause category. The remaining text identifies the
cause. A fault in the provider gives `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`.

### Save Rules

The save hook refuses these plans with `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE`. It does the checks in
this order:

1. A plan from an engine that is not an ingestor engine of this plugin handle.
2. A plan that the provider loaded from a payload.
3. A benchmarking plan that has not selected a kernel.
4. A kernel with a source kind other than kpack.
5. A plan whose dispatch handler does not support save.

Rule 2 has a result for the frontend: `to_binary()` of a graph that `from_binary()` loaded fails.
`to_compiled_plan_binary()` of a loaded plan also fails. Keep the original bytes of the payload.

For rule 3: a benchmarking plan usually selects its kernel at the first execute. A stored benchmark
result can cover all candidates. In that case, the build makes a plain plan, and the plan saves before
the first execute. To save a benchmarking plan, execute the plan one time, then save it. Or, build the
plan with benchmarking off.

The save hook reads the code object again from the kpack archive. It opens the archive at the path
from the plan build. It also checks the SHA-256 of the code object. When the archive is not
readable, the status is `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE`. When the bytes do not match the
SHA-256, the status is `HIPDNN_PLUGIN_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`. Do not change the archive between the
plan build and the save.

### Security

A saved plan contains executable GPU code. The load hook loads it, and the restored plan executes
it. Load only payloads from a trusted source.

- The SHA-256 values detect accidental damage. They do not detect a crafted payload.
- A load does not do the path checks of the descriptor tree. A save also does not repeat them.
- The driver function that loads the code object, `hipModuleLoadData`, takes no length. A crafted
  code object goes to the driver.

## Current Limitations

1. There is no frontend convenience API yet for querying `tensor_uids`; the backend exposes them via
   `HIPDNN_ATTR_EXECUTION_PLAN_TENSOR_UIDS_EXT`.
2. Deserialized execution-plan attribute semantics are only partially defined. In particular,
   `HIPDNN_ATTR_EXECUTION_PLAN_ENGINE_CONFIG` may not be reconstructable for graph-less plans.
3. The envelope does not include plugin identity. The current deserialization path relies on the
   handle's loaded engine plugin resource manager and the serialized engine ID/config.

## Proposed Improvements

### Add Plan Binding Query Helpers

Add frontend helpers to query tensor UID metadata from a compiled or deserialized plan:

```cpp
std::pair<std::vector<int64_t>, Error> get_compiled_plan_tensor_uids() const;
```

This avoids requiring users to call backend descriptor attributes directly.

### Define Deserialized Attribute Semantics

Document and enforce which execution-plan attributes are valid after deserialization. Attributes
that require the original graph or a reconstructed `EngineConfigDescriptor` should return a clear
unsupported or not-available status.

### Add File-Level Compatibility Tests

Add integration tests that persist compiled-plan files across process boundaries and plugin
versions once the fusilli payload compatibility policy is stable. The current unit coverage checks
malformed envelopes, missing and empty required fields, invalid workspace metadata, unsupported
plugin serialization, and plugin callback failures.

### Add Minimal Plugin Identity Metadata

Consider adding a small hipDNN-owned plugin identity section in a future envelope version. It should
be used only for routing and diagnostics, not for structuring the plugin payload. A conservative
first version could include plugin name, plugin version, and engine ID compatibility expectations.

### Improve Fusilli Payload Stability

The fusilli sample should eventually serialize a stable compiled artifact when fusilli exposes one.
Until then, fusilli owns compatibility for its payload bytes and may reject incompatible payloads.

## Non-Goals

- Serialize the hipDNN operation graph as part of compiled-plan serialization.
- Require graph-executor semantics from all backends.
- Define a common plugin payload schema.
- Rebuild from a source graph when direct compiled-plan deserialization fails.
