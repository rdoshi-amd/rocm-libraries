Migrate NVIDIA CUDA cuDNN projects to hipDNN
********************************************

This topic demonstrates how to migrate a NVIDIA CUDA cuDNN project to hipDNN.

Before you begin, ensure hipDNN (ROCm) is installed. See :ref:`prerequisites` for more information.

.. note::

  NVIDIA, CUDA, and cuDNN are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of NVIDIA Corporation.
  hipDNN is not affiliated with or endorsed by NVIDIA.

Here's a minimal example of a hipDNN project in ``CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code:: cmake

    project(my_app LANGUAGES CXX)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

    find_package(hipdnn_frontend CONFIG REQUIRED)

    add_executable(my_app main.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE hipdnn_frontend)

.. tip::

  See `Working examples in the Porting Guide <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/blob/develop/projects/hipdnn/docs/PortingGuide.md#working-examples>`_ for ported code samples.

Troubleshooting
===============

Prediction modes return no ranking
----------------------------------

Mode A ranks engines by their graph-level UHD prediction. Mode B prefers a
calibrated configuration prediction and falls back to the graph-level prediction
for each engine. Neither mode benchmarks the graph. Install compatible trained
models for the selected device architecture.

``HeuristicMode::A`` and ``HeuristicMode::B`` are not backend heuristic modes: the
frontend turns them into the ``SelectionHeuristic::ModeA`` and
``SelectionHeuristic::ModeB`` entries of the heuristic descriptor's ordered policy
list, always preceded by ``SelectionHeuristic::Config`` and followed by
``SelectionHeuristic::StaticOrdering``. If no applicable engine has a usable
prediction, the prediction policy declines and ordinary static engine selection
still runs, so ``graph.create_execution_plans({HeuristicMode::B})`` never fails for
want of a model. Setting ``HIPDNN_HEUR_POLICY_ORDER`` overrides the whole list.

Both modes rank by one *ranking metric*, ``tflops`` by default: calibrated
throughput, highest first. ``graph.set_ranking_metric("time")`` ranks by predicted
milliseconds, lowest first, and makes the chosen engine pick its kernel by predicted
time too; ``graph.get_ranking_metric()`` reads the choice back. An unregistered name
returns an ``Error`` and leaves the metric unchanged. An engine whose models do not
cover the requested metric is ranked after those that do, never by another metric,
so if no engine has a model for it the prediction policy declines exactly as above.
``HIPDNN_HEUR_RANKING_METRIC`` overrides the Graph's choice for heuristic selection.

Error: Different memory utilities for allocating device memory
--------------------------------------------------------------

The memory utilities are typically consumer dependent and written on an as-needed basis.
cuDNN provides a surface utility for their samples, for example.

To fix the issue, use ``MigratableMemory<type>``, a utility that can automatically migrate data between the host and device (it also works as a stand-in).
If you want to manage dims/strides more carefully, use the ``Tensor`` utility class. Both of these classes can be found in the ``hipdnn_data_sdk::utilities`` namespace.
