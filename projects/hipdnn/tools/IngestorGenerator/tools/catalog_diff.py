"""Compare a regenerated bundle against the shipped one, UUID-blind.

The no-op gate. Before a profile change can be trusted to preserve a shipped
catalog, regeneration has to be shown to reproduce it -- and the one comparison
that cannot be used is byte equality, because ``codegen/generator.py`` mints
every descriptor id with ``uuid.uuid4()``: two runs of the SAME config differ in
every id. So the ids are masked, and everything they point at is compared
instead.

    catalog_diff.py --shipped <a.kdp.json> --regenerated <b.kdp.json> [--ignore-ids]

The two halves are compared by different rules, because they are produced by
different things (see the generator's own split: only ``packs[].kernels`` comes
from the dispatcher):

  * the CATALOG -- ``kernelDescriptors`` -- as a multiset of
    ``(name, kernel_source.spec, metadata, priority)``. Order is not meaningful,
    but multiplicity is: two entries that differ only by id are two compiled
    kernels, and dropping one silently halves what ships.
  * the ENGINE-LEVEL blocks -- ``engine``/``dispatch``/``matchers`` references
    and every native symbol string -- compared with ids masked but symbols
    byte-equal, since a symbol is the entire contract with the native pack.

Exit 0 on no differences, 1 on any difference (with a report), 2 on bad usage.

What a pass does NOT establish: that the regenerated bundle is CORRECT, only
that it is the same catalog. A profile that is wrong in the same way twice
passes. And a KDP carries no UUID stability of its own -- the ``--ignore-ids``
mask is why this exits 0 at all, so preserving the SHIPPED ids through a splice
is a separate obligation (``extend.md``: resolve by UUID, not filename), checked
by ``--expect-ids``.

KMD comparison (``--shipped-kmd`` / ``--regenerated-kmd``):

The KDP carries only field NAMES via the ``specialization_contract``; the KMD
JSON holds field types and ``default_value`` entries, which are not visible in
the KDP. A ``default_value`` change (e.g., 512 → 256 for ``block_n``) silently
changes how the matcher completes partial records, so it is a semantic change that
the catalog comparison misses without the KMD. Pass both KMD files to catch it.
