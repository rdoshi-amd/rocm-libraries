# UHD Generation Tool

Train and export heuristic models for hipDNN's Universal Heuristic Descriptor (UHD) system.

## Overview

This tool takes benchmark timing data and produces:
1. A trained LightGBM model
2. A FlatBuffer model artifact (`model.bin`) for `TreeDataAdapter`
3. A UHD descriptor (`<stem>.uhd.json`) for the shared plugin-SDK runtime (RFC 0019 §4)

Promotion installs that pair into a descriptor tree. Every model -- L1 included -- is
reached through a reference in its owning UED's role map (RFC 0019 §3.1); a UHD never
names the engine it serves.

## Installation

```bash
cd projects/hipdnn/tools/uhd_gen
pip install -e .
```

## The pipeline

```

```

```bash
# 1. sweep: run the graphs you care about with benchmark logging on
HIPDNN_LOG_LEVEL=info HIPDNN_LOG_FILE=sweep.log <run your graphs>

# 2. export-benchmarks: log -> the §8.3 collection CSV, one per shard, appendable
python -m uhd_gen export-benchmarks sweep.log -o bench.csv

# 3. uhd_gen.dataset: the collected shards -> the published §8.3 dataset. This is where
#    §8.3's checks are applied, where a failed candidate's is_valid/skip_reason becomes
#    the dataset's `error`, and where tflops and gbs are derived from the `<root>.flops`
#    and `<root>.bytes` the engine published beside the problem (RFC 0019 §13.6) -- the
#    collector measures times, the engine that ran the graph knows what work it did.
python -m uhd_gen.dataset \
    --csv bench.csv \
    --out dataset.parquet

# 4. train: dataset -> descriptor + model artifact. A collected .csv works too, with a
#    target the CSV carries (a timing column) and none of §8.3's checks applied.
python -m uhd_gen train \
    --input dataset.parquet \
    --features q.M q.N q.K kernel.tile_m kernel.tile_n kernel.tile_k device.cu_count \
    --descriptor-tree ./descriptors --engine hipkernel:gemm \
    --training-arches gfx942 \
    --target tflops \
    --group-by benchmark device \
    --output-dir ./uhd_output \
    --descriptor-name gemm \
    --name "GEMM UHD"

# 5. evaluate: how much worse is the model's pick than the best kernel measured?
python -m uhd_gen evaluate \
    --input dataset.parquet \
    --model-dir ./uhd_output

# 6. promote: install the pair and update only its role/architecture reference
python -m uhd_gen promote \
    --model-dir ./uhd_output \
    --descriptor-tree ./descriptors \
    --engine hipkernel:gemm --arch gfx942
```

**Step 6 is not optional.** The UED's `sort_kernel_catalog` map must name the
model under the target architecture (or `default`). Promotion updates that entry;
other architectures and roles retain their existing models. An unavailable or
incompatible model disables only that model, leaving a valid engine usable with
deterministic priority/descriptor-ID ranking. A broken explicit architecture entry
does not silently select the default model.

### Feature columns use published symbol names

`--features` takes exact published column names without the leading `$`.
For example, `attention_dense.seqlen_q` becomes `$attention_dense.seqlen_q`.
The runtime does not add a synthetic `q.` namespace.

| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Engine-published graph, node, or tensor binding | `attention_dense.seqlen_q`, `q.dims[2]` |
| Per-candidate UKD metadata | `kernel.tile_m`, `kernel.split_k` |
| Device properties | `device.cu_count` |

Use the names returned by candidate enumeration. Renaming columns without changing
the engine's published bindings produces a model the engine cannot evaluate.

### Constant feature columns are dropped, and named

A column with one value across the whole input cannot separate one candidate from
another. `train` detects those before fitting, names each one with its value, and
**drops** it:

```
WARNING - Dropping 2 feature column(s) that never vary in this corpus:
kernel.tile_m=128, device.cu_count=304. RFC 0019.13 §10.4: this prunes model inputs
only, and leaves the engine's authored public knobs untouched.
```

No tree can split on such a column, so it adds nothing to the model — and it is not
free. RFC 0019 §6.3 hashes the whole `features_signature` into `features_hash`, so a
dead column enlarges the contract the runtime has to reproduce and bakes itself into the
descriptor's identity. Keeping it makes a later, more correct retrain that omits it read
as a contract break rather than as a better model.

**The test is variance in this corpus, never the column's name.** A rule of the form
"single-arch runs must not pass `device.*`" is wrong here:
`GenericPlanBuilder::candidateFeatures` deliberately supports merging a sweep across
several boards of one architecture, and gfx942 spans MI300X and MI325X, whose
`total_global_mem`, `memory_clock_rate` and `peak_memory_bandwidth` genuinely differ. The
8 `$device.*` fields `deviceFeatureValues` publishes therefore behave differently
depending on what was collected: a single-board corpus loses all 8, and a corpus merged
across those two boards keeps those 3 and loses the other 5.

Every drop is named with its value because constancy is measured against the corpus that
was collected, and a CSV cannot tell two opposite situations apart. rocKE's attention
kernels bake their geometry in, so the matcher pins 8 of their 14 fields before ranking
begins and those 8 can never vary. But a column that *does* vary in the world, sampled at
one value because the corpus is thin, reads identically — and only the author can tell
those apart. Naming the omission is what lets them: a thin sweep is fixed by collecting
more, not by shipping a feature no tree used.

`train_manifest.json` records `requested_features` and `dropped_constant_features` (each
with its constant value), so the provenance says what was asked for and what never varied.

- pruning a model input is never knob removal. Training and ordinary promotion preserve
  the UED's authored knobs (RFC 0019.13 §10.4). Explicit `promote --remove-knob NAME`
  requires a model trained against the intended major-revised UED and rejects removal of a
  field the model still consumes;
- when **two thirds or more** of the requested columns are constant, `train` warns that
  the proportion looks like a thin corpus and points at the input file. The threshold
  sits above the 8-of-14 rocKE shape (57%) on purpose: a warning that fires on every
  normal run is one people learn to ignore;
- when **every** requested column is constant, `train` fails and names each column with
  its value. That is an error, not an empty feature set: a model over zero varying
  features scores every candidate identically, and shipping one is worse than shipping
  none — the engine ranks by a model that cannot discriminate instead of falling back to
  its declared order.

### `train` arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--input` | Yes | Path to benchmark CSV/JSON |
| `--features` / `--feature-signature` | One | Exact published columns, or a JSON file containing inline feature expressions |
| `--descriptor-tree` / `--provenance` | One | Descriptor snapshot used for collection, or its recorded identity/revision provenance |
| `--engine` | If ambiguous | UED name or UUID in the descriptor tree |
| `--feature-evaluator` | Only if undiscoverable | Shared `hipdnn_uhd_features` executable. Every signature needs it, raw references included: it is the one implementation of `features_hash`. Looked up in this order — this flag, `HIPDNN_UHD_FEATURE_EVALUATOR`, `bin/` and `build/bin/` under the interpreter prefix or above this package, then PATH. All relative, so a checkout mounted at a different root inside a container resolves the same way |
| `--metric` | No | Ranking metric the score estimates (RFC 0019 §4.4): `tflops` (label column `tflops`, objective `max`) or `time` (label column `avgTimeMs`, objective `min`). Written as `score.metric`. Default: `tflops` when `--target` is omitted or is `tflops`; any other `--target` without `--metric` trains a metric-less ranker that orders its own catalog only. |
| `--target` | No | Target column name (default: the metric's label column). With a metric it must be that label; a contradiction is refused. |
| `--objective` | No | `max` or `min`. A metric fixes it and a contradicting value is refused; a metric-less model defaults to `max`, so pass `min` for a cost target such as `latency_ms`, or the runtime will prefer the *worst* kernel. |
| `--calibrated` | No | Declare the score cross-engine comparable — RFC 0019 §4.1's `score.calibrated` header, which §11.3 reads when it compares predicted values across engines. Requires a metric. Off by default; nothing here verifies the claim, but RFC 0019.13 §11.2 pins a calibrated score to `avgTimeMs`, so `--timing-statistic avgTimeMs` is required alongside it. |
| `--timing-statistic` | With `--calibrated` | Which measured timing the target was derived from (`avgTimeMs`, `minTimeMs`, `robustMeanMs`). Recorded in the manifest per §10.5: §11.2 refuses cross-engine comparison between models trained on different statistics, so it has to be readable off the artifact. |
| `--group-by` | No | Columns for GroupKFold CV |
| `--group-by-feature` | No | Train a two-layer (grouped) artifact keyed on this feature. Each group's layer-2 model is exported under the value the feature row carries — a string column's categorical code — which is what the runtime compares. Refused for `--role predict_engine`: the runtime scores an L1 model's root ensemble only, so a grouped L1 artifact has no per-row contract |
| `--output-dir` | Yes | Output directory |
| `--name` | No | UHD display name |
| `--descriptor-name` | No | Stem for the emitted descriptor (default: `heuristic`), producing `<stem>.uhd.json` |
| `--uhd-id` | No | Reuse this UUID as the descriptor's id instead of minting a fresh one |
| `--num-boost-round` | No | Max boosting rounds (default: 500) |
| `--early-stopping` | No | Early stopping patience (default: 50) |
| `--keep-lgbm` | No | Keep intermediate .lgbm file |
| `--training-arches` | No | Architectures the model was trained on, for §9.2 OOD detection |
| `--model-version` | No | Semantic version embedded in the model metadata |

`--uhd-id` makes retraining a no-edit operation: pass the id the engine's UED already
names and the pair is simply overwritten in place. A value that is not a UUID is
rejected before training starts — a typo'd id becomes the descriptor's *identity*, so
the UED would point at an id nothing defines and the engine would load with no
heuristic and no error.

`--role predict_engine` trains only on rows collected under the model's metric: every
row's `binding.metric` must equal `--metric`, and a mismatch fails naming both. A row
measured under the `tflops` selector records what that selector picked, so a `time` model
fitted on it models the wrong engine behaviour without any number looking wrong.

`train_manifest.json` records `training_problem_keys` — the problems (in `evaluate`'s
`(benchmark, device)` identity) the model was fitted on — for every role whose corpus has a
`benchmark` column, so a later standalone `evaluate` proves its holdout from content.

### `promote` arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--model-dir` | Yes | The `train --output-dir` result: one `<stem>.uhd.json` plus its artifact |
| `--descriptor-tree` | Yes | Tree holding the engine's `<name>.ued.json`; searched recursively |
| `--engine` | If ambiguous | The UED's `name` (e.g. `hipkernel:pointwise_model`) |
| `--arch` | Unless unambiguous | Target architecture, or explicit `default`; may be inferred from one training architecture |
| `--role` | No | UED model role (default: `sort_kernel_catalog`) |
| `--remove-knob` | No | Explicit authored knob removal; requires compatible major-revised training provenance |
| `--dry-run` | No | Print the plan, write nothing |
| `--uhd-id` | For an opaque engine, unless recorded | `METRIC=UUID` (repeatable) or a bare UUID for the one model being promoted. The model must already carry the id — `promote` never renames a model; a mismatch is refused |
| `--feature-evaluator` | Only if undiscoverable | Shared `hipdnn_uhd_features` of the build the model is promoted for, looked up as for `train`. A model with a `features_signature` whose recorded `trained_against.feature_semantics_revision` (absent means 1) differs from the revision this evaluator reports is refused, naming both — the loader would refuse it the same way |

`promote` copies the descriptor and artifact into the UED's directory — under
`heuristics/<ued-id>/<role>/<arch>/<metric>/`, or directly under `<arch>/` for a
metric-less ranker — and binds it under `<role>.<arch>`. `sort_kernel_catalog` and
`predict_engine` bind a **list** per arch, one UHD per `score.metric` (RFC 0019 §3.1):
the incoming UHD replaces only the bound UHD of its own metric (read from the bound UHD
itself, which must therefore be installed in the tree) and otherwise joins the list; a
single id is converted to a list. `predict_applicable_kernels` stays a single id. It
preserves other model references and authored knobs.

**One UUID is one model, under every arch key that binds it.** Promoting a model already
installed elsewhere in the tree for another arch binds the installed copy (no second
copy) when its document and artifact bytes are identical, and re-promoting identical
content changes nothing. The same id with *different* content is refused: it would
silently change what every other arch binding of that id scores with. Train the
replacement under a new id, or promote it to the arch it is installed for to replace it
in place.

An engine with no UED (MIOpen, AITER) reads only the UHD ids its provider declares, per
metric. The id `promote` installs under must be that declaration: the one the collection
recorded (`train_manifest.json`'s `binding.uhd_id`, which the engine's description
reports), or `--uhd-id METRIC=UUID`. With neither, promotion is refused — a model under
any other id is one the engine never reads. Because the loader keys on the id, not the
path, a different model already installed under that id anywhere in the tree is
**replaced where it lies** (document and artifact, under their existing file names) when
it is this slot's model: a `tree_data` model of the same `score.metric` whose artifact's
training architectures are all among those being promoted for (`--arch`, or the
manifest's `training_arches` for `--arch default`). That is how a retrained ASM SDPA
model replaces the one shipped beside the provider. An installed model under the id that
serves another metric or architecture, or whose coverage cannot be read, is refused, and
so is the id installed twice.

It validates everything before writing anything, and refuses rather than half-succeed:

- the descriptor must satisfy the canonical schema and its artifact must exist;
  missing or incompatible models otherwise leave runtime selection in fallback. As the
  runtime parser requires, the `artifact` or `library` path is relative, `/`-separated and
  names a file inside the descriptor's directory (no leading `/`, no `\`, `:` or NUL, no
  `..` segment anywhere, and a final segment other than empty or `.`), a declared `hash` is 64
  lowercase hex digits with no prefix, and a `custom_library` body declares its `hash`;
- the artifact must pass the checks the runtime applies when it loads it: for
  `tree_data`, the declared digest, the `HGBM` file identifier, the FlatBuffers
  verifier's structural checks (every offset, vtable, vector, string terminator and nested
  table, as `VerifyGbdtModelBuffer`), the artifact's `features_hash` matching the
  descriptor's, and its `num_features` equal to the `features_signature` slot count; for
  any other artifact, the declared digest. A `predict_engine` model must not be a grouped
  (two-layer) artifact. A `custom_library` body's `config` must be omitted or empty, as
  the runtime parser requires.
  The descriptor's `features_hash` is recomputed from its `features_signature` and
  `categorical_encoding` through the feature evaluator, as the loader does, rather than
  compared with another stored copy.
  When the descriptor declares no digest, `promote` writes the artifact's (bare hex
  SHA-256, as the runtime compares it) into the installed copy, so the runtime's model
  identity follows the bytes installed rather than a UUID that outlives a weight change;
- with more than one UED in the tree, `--engine` is **required**. Promoting into the
  wrong engine fails twice over: the engine you retrained keeps its old model, and one
  you never touched starts ranking with a model trained for a different kernel set.
  Both load cleanly and report nothing, so this is never guessed;
- replacing a descriptor or artifact still used by another engine, role, or
  architecture is refused. Use distinct artifact and descriptor paths;
- recorded UED, KMD, and UMD identities/revisions must remain compatible, checked per
  target arch: every matcher of a pack serving that arch that the model recorded must
  still exist at a compatible revision; recorded matchers that only the engine's
  *other*-arch packs own are ignored (a model collected over gfx942 and gfx950 packs is
  valid on each), and one no pack of the engine owns any more is refused. This is the rule
  the runtime loader applies.
- every `$kernel.*` axis the signature reads (by base name: `$kernel.tile[0]` reads
  `tile`) must be a field of the engine's KMD **and** a knob of its UED as installed,
  after any `--remove-knob`. The runtime drops any other model and ranks by priority, then
  id (RFC 0019 §6.3 check 2). Problem-side facts such as dtype, head counts or causal
  come from the graph's own columns, never `$kernel.*`;
- a `predict_engine` model for a descriptor-backed engine must record
  `trained_against.selector_revision`, which the runtime compares with the engine's
  current selector revision. Every binding `hipdnn_bench` records carries it.

## `evaluate`: regret against the best kernel that was measured

RMSE on `log1p(target)` is what `train` reports, and it can improve while the model's
*choice* gets worse. `evaluate` measures the choice, per RFC 0019.13 §11.2 and §11.4:

- **top-1 regret** — how much worse the model's pick is than the oracle `v*(p)`, the
  best measured candidate for that problem. `t(v̂)/t(v*) − 1` under `objective: min`,
  `1 − t(v̂)/t(v*)` under `max`; non-negative either way, reported as mean, p50, p95,
  max;
- **regret tail** — the fraction of problems whose regret exceeds 5%;
- **top-k recall** — how often the oracle is in the model's top k, for k = 1, 3, 5;
- **per-regime regret** — the same mean, grouped by the corpus's regime column. §11.2
  makes this the *primary* form: an aggregate hides a model that is excellent on the
  dense middle of the corpus and useless on decode-shaped or prime-dimension problems.
- **§11.4 references** — the same figures for the two things the model has to be read
  against: the **static order** the engine ships (its `priority`/`id` ordering, read
  off the corpus's enumeration order) and **random** choice from `V(p)`, plus the
  oracle's zero. The model's regret is not interpretable alone: §11.4 wants to know
  whether it beats the ordering it replaces. It also warns when it does not, in
  aggregate (MUST 2) or in any one regime (MUST 3).

The model's pick is the one the engine would make: a candidate is rankable only when its
recovered score is finite and, for a physical score (a declared `score.metric`, or a
`log`/`log1p`/`sqrt` transform), positive. Anything else the runtime discards, so it
ranks last in declared order here too, and calibration leaves it out and counts it as
`excluded_runtime_discarded_predictions`. This is the only regret `uhd_gen` reports:
`train` has no out-of-fold estimate, because one fitted unlike the exported model
describes a model nobody ships.

It writes `eval_report.json` — the artifact §10.4 names — into `--model-dir`.

```bash
python -m uhd_gen evaluate --input bench.csv --model-dir ./uhd_output
```

```

```

### A problem is `(benchmark, device)`

The same graph on two GPUs is two problems with two different best kernels. Grouped on
`benchmark` alone, the oracle becomes the best kernel on whichever card is faster and
the regret figure is a different quantity — on the demo corpus above, conflating two
devices moved the mean from 0.70 to 0.26.

A corpus exported before the `device` column existed carries it empty on every row.
`evaluate` degrades to `benchmark` alone rather than refusing, and says so on stdout,
in `grouping.degraded`, and in `warnings[]`:

```
!! DEGRADED PROBLEM GROUPING: problems are identified by 'benchmark' ALONE because
no 'device' column in this corpus ... They are not comparable with figures from a
corpus that carries device identity. Re-export from a sweep that logs the `device`
column.
```

### The split holds out problems, not rows

Regret belongs to the evaluation slice (§5.6.4); on training data it is optimistic and
is not the number anyone wants. `evaluate` holds out `--eval-fraction` of the
**problems**, assigned by a seeded SHA-256 of the problem key — reproducible from
`(corpus, --seed)` alone, and independent of row order, so concatenating a log
differently does not move the slice.

Splitting *rows* would put some of a problem's candidates in training and the rest in
evaluation. The evaluation-side oracle would then be the best of a subset, and a
mediocre pick would look correct because the better candidate was not there to compare
against. On the fixture in `tests/test_evaluate.py` that turns a true regret of 3.00
into 2.25; the tests assert the group-aware figure.

The model must not have trained on the evaluation problems, and only problem identity
can show that. `train` records the `(benchmark, device)` keys it fitted on as
`training_problem_keys`; `evaluate` compares them with every evaluated problem: disjoint
is `held_out`, any shared problem is `COMPROMISED` (printed first, with the count). A
model that records no keys reports `unknown` — a different file name is not evidence,
since a renamed copy of the training corpus is the same problems. When one side has no
device identity the keys are compared on the graph alone, and a shared graph is
`unknown`. The fix for a compromised run is one extra step:

```bash
# write the training side of the split, then fit on that
python -m uhd_gen evaluate --input bench.csv --model-dir ./uhd_output \
    --emit-train-slice train_slice.csv
python -m uhd_gen train --input train_slice.csv ... --output-dir ./uhd_honest
python -m uhd_gen evaluate --input bench.csv --model-dir ./uhd_honest   # same --seed
```

On the demo corpus that raises the reported mean regret from 0.45 to 0.70: the leak was
worth a third of the number.

### What is excluded, and what is not

§5.6.3 warns that dropping a configuration from the evaluation slice removes it from
the oracle. So only rows that carry no usable measurement are dropped, and every drop
is counted in `exclusions`:

| Excluded | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `is_valid=False` rows | A candidate that never ran has no time and cannot be the best. Its empty timing column would otherwise read as a zero and win every `min`. Only a collected CSV carries the flag. |
| `numerically_valid=False` rows | A candidate checked wrong has no time for the right answer; a direct corpus may still carry its wrong answer's (fast) timing, which would otherwise become the oracle. Counted as `numerically_invalid_rows`; an undecided (null) verdict stays. |
| Rows whose target is empty or non-numeric | Same reason, without the flag -- which is how a published dataset spells it, since §8.3 has no validity column and records the failure in `error` instead. |
| Problems with one measured candidate | With nothing to choose between, a correct pick is not evidence; scoring it as regret 0 would dilute the mean. |
| Problems whose oracle value is not positive | Both formulas divide by it, and under `max` the ratio's sense flips. |

Every measured candidate of an evaluated problem stays in `V(p)`.

### Ties within noise

Regret needs no tie rule — it is measured in the target metric, so two kernels a
fraction of a percent apart produce a regret a fraction of a percent from zero, which
is §11.2's stated reason for measuring it that way. **Top-k recall does need one**: it
is a rank test, and it scores the second of two statistically indistinguishable kernels
as an outright miss.

So recall is reported twice. `strict` demands the exact oracle row in the top k.
`tie_aware` accepts any candidate that is tied with the oracle, where tied means either

- within `--tie-rel-tolerance` (default 1%) of the oracle's measured value — unit-free,
  works for either objective, and it is the same quantity the regret column reports, so
  "tied" means exactly "costs less than 1%"; or
- within `--tie-sigma` standard errors of it, using `stddevMs` and `iters`. Applied
  **only** when the target is a millisecond timing (`minTimeMs`, `avgTimeMs`,
  `robustMeanMs`), because `stddevMs` is in milliseconds and widening a TFLOPS
  comparison by it would be a units error. For `avgTimeMs` that band is exact; for
  `minTimeMs` — §8.5's default target — and for `robustMeanMs`, the sample spread is a
  scale for the noise rather than that estimator's own error, so the band is
  approximate and deliberately so: the alternative is no noise notion at all for
  either.

The band needs the columns to be there. §8.3 makes `stddevMs` and `iters` part of the
result envelope, and both `export-benchmarks` and `generate` emit them; a corpus that
drops them turns the band off, and `ties.policy` then names the missing column rather
than blaming the target's units. `evaluate` also warns loudly, because nothing else in
the report changes when the band goes away.

`topk_recall.trivial` records the fraction of problems with no more than k measured
candidates, so a recall@5 of 1.0 on 4-candidate problems is legible as the tautology it
is.

### `evaluate` arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--input` | Yes | Benchmark CSV/JSON to evaluate on |
| `--model-dir` | Yes | A `train --output-dir` result |
| `--model` | No | Artifact to rank with (default: `model.lgbm` if kept, else the descriptor's `tree_data.artifact` — the file the engine itself loads) |
| `--output` | No | Report path (default: `<model-dir>/eval_report.json`) |
| `--eval-fraction` | No | Fraction of **problems** held out and scored (default: 0.2; `1.0` scores everything and says loudly that the figure is optimistic) |
| `--seed` | No | Seed for the problem-level split (default: 0), recorded in the report |
| `--target` | No | Measured column regret is computed in (default: the manifest's `target`) |
| `--objective` | No | Override the direction read from the descriptor/manifest. Refused when it contradicts the descriptor's `score.metric` |
| `--device-column` | No | Column holding device identity (default: `device`) |
| `--regime-column` | No | Regime column for the per-regime table (default: the first of `regime`, `corpus_regime`, `q.regime`, `problem.regime` that is present) |
| `--tie-rel-tolerance` | No | Tie tolerance for tie-aware recall (default: 0.01) |
| `--tie-sigma` | No | Noise-band width in standard errors (default: 2.0) |
| `--regret-tail-threshold` | No | Tail cutoff (default: 0.05, §11.2's 5%) |
| `--include-per-problem` | No | Write every problem's oracle, pick and regret into the report |
| `--emit-train-slice` | No | Write the training side of this split to a CSV |

The **objective is read, never assumed** — from the descriptor, falling back to the
manifest. Both directions are legal and the wrong one inverts every number, so a corpus
that offers neither is an error rather than a guess. A descriptor naming a `score.metric`
fixes the direction (`tflops` max, `time` min), so regret is always computed in the
metric's direction. Regret is asserted non-negative; a negative one means the direction
is backwards, and `evaluate` fails instead of printing a plausible small number.

### `eval_report.json`

| Key | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| `schema` | `uhd_gen.eval_report/1` |
| `corpus` | path, row count, problem count |
| `metric`, `target`, `objective` | the descriptor's `score.metric` (null for a metric-less ranker), and what regret was measured in, in which direction |
| `grouping` | the problem-identity columns, `degraded`, and why |
| `split` | method, unit, seed, fraction, train/eval problem counts, and the evaluated problem keys |
| `slice` | that `V(p)` is what the sweep measured rather than every applicable configuration, so `v*(p)` is a lower bound (§11.1) |
| `exclusions` | counts by reason, plus the policy that produced them |
| `metrics` | `problems_scored`, `top1_regret` (mean/p50/p95/max), `regret_tail`, `topk_recall` (`strict`/`tie_aware`/`trivial`), `per_regime`, `per_regime_status`, and `references` |
| `metrics.references` | §11.4's `oracle`, `static_order` and `random`, each carrying the same `top1_regret`/`regret_tail`/`topk_recall`/`per_regime` block plus a note on how it was derived |
| `ties` | tolerance, sigma, whether the noise band applied, and the policy |
| `model` | artifact, features, what it was trained on, how many rows |
| `holdout_integrity` | `held_out`, `COMPROMISED`, or `unknown`, with the reason; `generate --recall` records `recall` |
| `not_implemented` | the parts of §11.2/§11.3/§11.4 this command does not compute |
| `warnings` | every loud condition, in the order printed |
| `per_problem` | with `--include-per-problem`: key, regime, candidate count, oracle, pick, regret, ranks |

`per_regime` is `null` when the corpus has no regime column, and `per_regime_status`
says so — an absent metric someone expected is worse than a stated gap.

`not_implemented` names what is missing rather than leaving a reader to infer it:
§11.2's regime-weighted aggregates (nothing declares weights yet), its calibration
metrics (required only when `score.calibrated` is true), §11.3's leave-one-regime-out
and leave-variants-out splits (both need retraining per fold), §5.6.3's round-0
core versus full slice and steering versus reserved portions (properties of a corpus
collected by the campaign loop, which does not exist yet), and two of §11.4's
obligations — MUST 4's regression check against a previously promoted UHD, which has no
loader here, and item 5's scoring-time comparison, which §11.4 itself notes is blocked
on the §11.6 (B5) harness.

§11.4's static-order reference is read off the corpus: a problem's rows are in the
order the engine enumerated its catalog, which is the `priority`/`id` order Stage 1
ships, so the static pick is the first row carrying a usable measurement. A corpus
re-sorted after collection no longer carries that order, and the reference then
describes a permutation rather than the shipped one; the note in the report says so.
The random reference is an exact expectation over `V(p)`, never a sampled draw, so the
sanity floor does not move between runs.

## Input Format

`--input` takes three forms and the suffix decides, for `train`, `evaluate`, `knobs` and
`merge` alike:

| Suffix | What it is | When |
|--------|------------|------|
| `.parquet` | The dataset `uhd_gen/dataset` publishes from collected shards (§8.3) | The route a model anyone ships should come by |
| `.csv` | A collected corpus, read directly | A quick local run |
| `.json` | The same rows as records | Hand-written corpora and fixtures |

**Collection stays CSV; publication is Parquet.** The format that has to survive a
two-day sweep and the format a trainer wants are not the same format. Parquet writes
its footer last, so a run killed mid-flight leaves a file that cannot be read at all,
against §8's requirement that the benchmark step be resumable from a partial result;
and a Parquet file cannot be appended to, so §8.8's "shard outputs merge by appending"
would become a full rewrite. CSV has both properties. So `hipdnn_bench` and
`export-benchmarks` keep writing CSV, and `uhd_gen.dataset` reads the merged shards
once, derives `tflops` and `gbs` from the engine's published counts, and writes the
typed dataset:

```bash
python -m uhd_gen.dataset \
    --csv shards/*.csv \
    --out dataset.parquet

python -m uhd_gen train --input dataset.parquet ...
```

Prefer the dataset for the reason that argued for Parquet in the first place: it
carries its own column types, so a column that is empty in one shard and populated in
another cannot concatenate to `object` and quietly change what the trainer sees. The
CSV branch is the escape hatch, not the route -- nothing §8.3 specifies is checked on
it (no measurement-or-error rule, no completeness agreement, no candidate-set
comparison across a merge), which is what the importer exists for.

**A failure is spelled differently at the two ends, and the importer is where it is
translated.** The collector writes what the runtime record carries at the moment of
failure: `is_valid=False`, a `skip_reason`, and empty timing columns. §8.3's published
dataset carries no validity flag at all -- a failed candidate is a null measurement plus
a non-empty `error` -- so that no two columns can disagree about whether a row was
measured. `uhd_gen.dataset` rewrites the one into the other and then drops `is_valid` and
`skip_reason` as collection bookkeeping, which is why the chain above composes: a sweep
containing a failure is a normal sweep, not a corpus the importer refuses.

**A candidate checked wrong is a failure too, with its verdict kept.** The bench's timing
flag is independent of its correctness check, so a kernel that computed the wrong answer
quickly arrives `is_valid` with a fast time. A row with `numerically_valid=False` is
published with its timings and `tflops`/`gbs` null, its `validation` reason copied into
`error` (or `numerically_valid=False` when it gave none), and its problem marked
incomplete -- but unlike the collector's flag, `numerically_valid` and `validation` stay as
columns, so evaluation and promotion see the same verdict generation recorded. A row
`generate` already suppressed publishes the same way. Null is undecided, not wrong: it
stays a measurement. Every entrance -- `generate`, `train`, `uhd_gen.dataset`,
`import-immediate`, `evaluate`, `promote` -- reads the verdict through one helper,
`uhd_gen/correctness.py`, so none of them can disagree about which rows it covers.

`train` drops a row that carries no measurement in either spelling -- the flag, a
non-empty `error`, or a target that is not a finite number -- and a row checked
numerically wrong whatever it carries, and logs how many went by each. The failed rows
stay in the dataset, because a candidate that could not run is information about feature
space and §8.3 keeps it; they are excluded at the fit, exactly as `evaluate` excludes
them from the oracle.

**Identity columns are read as text on every route.** `benchmark`, `device`, `graph_id`
and `device_id` name something; nothing computes with them. Left to inference a device
called `0007` becomes the integer 7 from one format and the string `"0007"` from the
other, and one problem becomes two.

Whichever form it arrives in, the corpus must carry:
- Feature columns (problem dimensions, kernel config, device properties)
- Target column (typically TFLOPS or time)

The §11.2 label rule is applied to all three alike: a `--calibrated` model must be
trained with `--timing-statistic avgTimeMs`, and the published dataset earns no
exemption from it.

Example CSV:
```csv
M,N,K,tile_m,tile_n,tile_k,cu_count,tflops
1024,1024,1024,128,128,32,120,50.5
2048,2048,2048,256,128,32,120,75.2
...
```

### Inline computed features and device coverage

Pass `--feature-signature features.json` instead of `--features`:

```json
[
  "$kernel.tile_m",
  "$device.cu_count",
  {"ceil_div": ["$q.dims[2]", "$kernel.tile_m"]}
]
```

Build `hipdnn_uhd_features`. Training and runtime use the same descriptor expression
language (the kernel ingestor's `jsonexpr`), and the tool also owns `features_hash`: RFC 0019 §6.3
gives that digest one definition, `FeatureExtractor::computeHash`, which the tool
asks for rather than reimplements. So the binary is needed for every training run,
not only for signatures containing expressions, and a run that cannot find it fails
naming what to supply instead of stamping a digest nothing verified. Expressions and
categorical vocabularies are part of the feature hash; there is no separate named
`derived` block.

Every evaluator response also carries `feature_semantics_revision`, the build's
`FEATURE_SEMANTICS_REVISION` (`hipdnn_plugin_sdk/heuristics/FeatureSemantics.hpp`): what the
values behind published feature names *mean*. `features_hash` fingerprints which names a
model reads, not how the C++ computes them, so a change to a FLOP or byte convention, an
operand encoding or a feature name bumps this revision instead. `train` records the
evaluator's revision in `trained_against.feature_semantics_revision`; `promote` and
`evaluate` refuse a model whose recorded revision differs from their evaluator's, naming
both; and the loader refuses it at bind time for every role, logging both revisions (an
opaque engine's declared `predict_engine` model reports `UNAVAILABLE` with that reason, and a
UED role-mapped model is disabled like any other provenance refusal, the engine keeping its
declared-order fallback). A document recording no revision — every model trained before it
existed — is revision 1, and so is an evaluator whose responses carry none. Only models with a
`features_signature` are subject to it: a
signature-less ranker reads no published feature.

An explicit computed expression using a device field that never varied in the
training corpus is rejected. Automatic feature proposals omit such expressions
and retain the raw device field — which training then drops on the same evidence,
by the variance rule above, naming it with its value. `device_coverage` in
`train_manifest.json` records the observed values of every device field either way.

A value a row does not publish is **absent**, never zero and never NaN: a conv-fwd row
has no `dy`, and pandas fills that hole with NaN, which `evaluate_feature_rows` turns back
into JSON `null` before the evaluator sees it (a column no row publishes goes over as
`null` too). The evaluator treats `null` as unbound, exactly like the runtime: a bare
`$graph.nodes[0].dy.dims[0]` makes that row unscorable, while
`{"value_or_default": ["$graph.nodes[0].dy.dims[0]", 0]}` or `present` state what an
absent input means. Aggregates follow the same rule: "no node of this type" may sum to 0,
but "work unknown" stays absent and is never silently 0. Whether a signature is usable on
a corpus is therefore the evaluator's answer over the published feature maps
(`check_signature_evaluates`), not a check that every referenced name is published.

### Reproducible generation

`python -m uhd_gen generate --help` describes the combined workflow. It accepts
graph files or corpus directories, enumerates matched candidates through
`hipdnn_bench enumerate`, checks identities and knob tuples during timing, then
trains, evaluates a held-out problem/device split, and promotes.
`--no-promote` validates installation without changing the shipping tree.

`--metric` names the ranking metrics to train (`tflops`, `time`; repeatable or
space-separated; default `tflops`). One run emits **one UHD per metric** (RFC 0019
§13.4): with a single metric the model lands in `model/` exactly as before; with several,
each lands in `model_<metric>/`, is evaluated on its own, and is promoted in turn — each
promotion adds its UHD to the arch's role list and replaces only that metric's entry.
The catalog sweep is timed once and feeds every metric. `--uhd-id METRIC=UUID`
(repeatable) names a metric's UHD id; a bare UUID names the UHD of a single-metric run
and is refused when more than one metric is requested. An engine with no UED (MIOpen,
AITER) reads only the ids its provider declares per metric, and its description reports
the one for the requested metric as `binding.uhd_id`: `generate` trains and promotes
under that id, refuses a `--uhd-id` that contradicts it, and — when the engine reports
none and no `--uhd-id` names one — stops after the first graph rather than minting an id
the engine would never read. `generation_manifest.json` (`uhd_gen.generation/2`) records
a `models` entry per UHD with its metric, id, directory, corpus and the exact
train/evaluate commands.

A catalog ranker is fitted only on axes the **shipping** UED admits. Collection exposes
every KMD field so every catalog entry is reachable, but `generate` offers `$kernel.*`
features only for the shipping UED's knobs. A field the matcher binds from the graph
(dtype, head counts, causal, ...) is read from its problem-side twin column instead.
`generation_manifest.json`'s `withheld_kernel_fields` lists every KMD field that was not
offered, with the reason (`graph_bound` and the column to read instead, or
`not_a_shipping_knob`). An authored `--feature-signature`/`--features` that reads any other
kernel field is refused before training.

`--graphs` takes both serialized forms: hand-written or exported `*.json`, and the
binary FlatBuffers `hipdnn_corpus_gen` writes as `graphs/<operation>_<n>.fb`, so a
generated corpus composes with `generate` directly. A `hipdnn_corpus_gen` root (or its
`manifest.json` itself) is read through the manifest's `graphs[].file` list — the
manifest is never collected as a graph, and a listed file that is missing is an error;
any other directory is searched recursively, skipping `manifest.json`. Form is decided
by content rather than extension, the same way `hipdnn_bench` decides it, so a renamed
file still loads. An ID-less JSON graph is given a reproducible UUID5 of its canonical
content; a serialized graph already carries its own id and the bench preserves it, so
nothing is injected there.

**One bad graph costs that graph, not the run.** A graph whose collection fails (the
bench crashes, or its response fails validation) is skipped for every device and metric
and recorded with its error under `failed_graphs` in `generation_manifest.json`. Up to
`--max-graph-failures` of the graphs (a fraction, default `0.05`) may fail; more fails
the run and lists them, since failures that common are systematic, not incidental. The
measurements of the graphs that did collect are not lost: the run writes them as a
collection (`collection_manifest.json`, with every failure under `failed_graphs`) in the
staging directory it reports, publishes no output directory and trains nothing. After
investigating the failures, `python -m uhd_gen.dataset add --collection <staging-directory>`
converts that collection, and `generate --dataset` trains on it without measuring again.

Collection times **one invocation per graph**: `hipdnn_bench enumerate` decides the
candidate set, then a single `hipdnn_bench --sweep --json` times every candidate in
that set, in one process. Plugin load, graph build and kernel compilation are paid
once per graph instead of once per row, which is most of the wall time on kernels
that run in well under a millisecond. Collection pins restrict which candidates are
enrolled; they are never combined with a candidate's own settings, so one enrolled
tuple still times exactly one candidate. The sweep must return exactly the
enumerated candidates — a subset is silent data loss and fails the run.

The trade is crash granularity: a candidate that fails to build or run is reported
as an unsuccessful result and still reaches the corpus, but a candidate that crashes
the process costs its graph's remaining rows rather than only its own.

Each candidate is timed with STANDARD autotune; an internal exhaustive sweep must
not substitute a different kernel. Providers that do not implement enumeration
report unsupported, not an empty catalog. `is_valid` keeps its timing-based meaning
— "a measurement was obtained" — and `numerically_valid` carries the separate
per-candidate correctness verdict beside it.

Every collected row carries §8.3's envelope, `stddevMs` and `iters` included, so
`evaluate`'s noise band works on a generated corpus rather than being inert on it.

**A failure never destroys the measurements.** Collection is the expensive half of a
run, and §8.7 is explicit that measurements outlive the strategy that requested them,
so a failure anywhere after collection — training, evaluation, an empty holdout,
installation validation — leaves the staging directory in place and names it in the
error. It is only consumed by the rename into `--output-dir` that a successful run
performs, so nothing accumulates from runs that worked. Delete a reported stage once
you no longer need what it measured.

**What the catalog model is scored in.** Each metric fixes its label (RFC 0019 §13.4):
`tflops` is `graph.flops / (avgTimeMs * 1e9)`, derived per candidate from the engine's
published `graph.flops`; `time` is `avgTimeMs` itself. Either is trained as
`sort_kernel_catalog` with `score.calibrated: true` and the metric's objective (`max`,
`min`) — `avgTimeMs` because RFC 0019.13 §11.2 pins a calibrated score to the mean. That
is what gives the role the cross-engine standing RFC 0019 §11.1 describes, and with it
§11.2's `B only` ranking row. When no `--metric` was given and the engine publishes no
work count, it falls back to `robustMeanMs`/`min`/uncalibrated with **no** `score.metric`
— the engine's metric-less default ranker, which is legal (§2.5, §15.1), ranks this
engine's own catalog just as well, and warns that the score is no longer comparable with
another engine's; the thorough policy then falls back to the engine's L1 prediction. An
explicitly requested `--metric tflops` without a work count fails instead.

`generate` takes the work count from the engine's own published `graph.flops`, which is
the effective count the runtime computed for the graph it just ran. A corpus that was
collected as CSV and published by `uhd_gen.dataset` instead carries `tflops` and `gbs`
derived from the `<root>.flops` and `<root>.bytes` that same engine logged beside the
problem, and the row's own `avgTimeMs` -- the statistic a calibrated label is defined on,
in both paths. Both take the count from the engine and differ only in which of its
outputs they read. `--resolve-duplicates` keys a problem on its shape, graph and device
together, so one shape measured on two boards stays two problems.

### Regenerating a shipped model

On a GPU of the target architecture, with the provider built and its descriptors staged:

```bash
cd projects/hipdnn/tools
PLUGINS=<build>/lib/hipdnn_plugins/engines

# 1. A corpus for the engine: every candidate problem is offered to it, so the corpus is
#    what that engine serves. Deterministic from the seed and the in-tree inputs.
<build>/bin/hipdnn_corpus_gen --operations corpus_gen/operations --operation sdpa_fwd \
    --plugin-dir $PLUGINS --engine-name <engine> --output corpus --count 1000 --seed 0

# 2. L2 (catalog ranker), then L1 (engine estimate). L2 goes first because an immediate
#    run executes whatever the installed catalog ranker picks, so L1's labels then
#    describe the selector that ships. An engine with no catalog to rank takes L1 alone.
COMMON="--graphs corpus --descriptor-tree <tree> --engine <engine> --engine-id <id> \
    --bench <build>/bin/hipdnn_bench --plugin-dir $PLUGINS \
    --feature-evaluator <build>/bin/hipdnn_uhd_features --metric tflops time --arch <arch>"
python -m uhd_gen generate $COMMON --role sort_kernel_catalog --output-dir out/l2
python -m uhd_gen generate $COMMON --role predict_engine --output-dir out/l1
```

`--engine-id` is the id `hipdnn_list_engines` reports for the engine. `generate` promotes
into `--descriptor-tree`; `promote` installs a kept model (`out/l1/model_<metric>/`) into
the source tree, run with `--dry-run` first. `reproduce/compare_engines.py` joins
several engines' L1 `corpus*.csv` on the corpus manifest's `benchmark` ids and reports,
per ranking metric, coverage and per-regime winners over the graphs more than one engine
serves. A row counts only toward the metric its `binding.metric` was collected under, so a
label may name both of an engine's corpora (`MIOpen=corpus_tflops.csv`,
`MIOpen=corpus_time.csv`).

### Engine-level immediate predictions

`predict_engine` trains an engine's **normal untuned performance**, not the best
configuration found by a sweep. Collection builds only that engine's plan with
`global.benchmarking=0`, and `generate` runs the bench with `HIPDNN_FORCE_BENCHMARKING=0` so
an inherited override cannot turn the search back on; it warms the plan up and measures
ordinary execution with HIP events.
It does not enumerate configurations or invoke autotune; normal engine cache behavior is
unchanged. Full-graph work and elapsed time determine the TFLOPS label; unsupported work
accounting is not replaced with a guessed label. Only a `tflops` collection needs
`graph.flops`: a `time` collection over graphs whose provider publishes no FLOP count is
complete, and its rows carry no `tflops`.

The `tflops` label is `graph.flops / (avgTimeMs * 1e9)`; the `time` label is `avgTimeMs`.
RFC 0019.13 §11.2 (:2003) requires a UHD declaring `calibrated: true` to train on
`avgTimeMs`, and §10.6.2 repeats it for this role specifically; L1 always declares it, so
the mean is the label and never the minimum or the robust mean. `robustMeanMs` stays on
every corpus row as §8.5's informational statistic, alongside `stddevMs` and `iters`.
Which statistic produced the label is recorded as `timing_statistic` in
`train_manifest.json`, because §11.2 refuses cross-engine comparison between models
trained on different ones.

The engine picks its kernel at plan build with its ranker for the request's metric
(RFC 0019 §11.4), so an immediate measurement belongs to one metric: collection passes
`--ranking-metric <metric>` and checks the response names it, and a multi-metric L1 run
collects once per metric into `corpus_<metric>.json`. Every row's `binding.metric` names
the metric it was described under; normalization refuses a row without one, and `train`
and `evaluate` refuse rows whose metric (or selector revision) differs from the model's,
naming both.

An immediate row keeps its `numerically_valid` verdict and `validation` reason through
import and readback. A pick checked wrong (`false`) keeps its row with every timing and
derived label null, and `generate`, `train` and `evaluate` leave it out of the labels and
the oracle; null -- what today's collector writes, since one engine's single pick has no
reference to compare against -- is undecided and trains.

The bench measures against `--descriptor-tree` and nothing else, for both roles: it is
passed as `HIPDNN_DESCRIPTOR_DIR` (the replacement root; L2 passes its knob-expanded copy
of it), and any inherited `HIPDNN_DESCRIPTOR_RUNTIME_DIR`/`HIPDNN_DESCRIPTOR_PATH` is
cleared. Those add roots, and the loader keeps the first definition of an id, so an
earlier root's selector would otherwise produce labels for a tree this run never
installs into. The tree must therefore be a complete root the engine can load from (for a
kpack-backed provider, the arch root that owns `kpack`), exactly as for L2.

```bash
hipdnn_bench --graph graph.json --engine-name vendor:gemm \
    --describe-engine-prediction --workspace-limit 67108864
hipdnn_bench --graph graph.json --engine-name vendor:gemm \
    --collect-immediate --ranking-metric tflops --workspace-limit 67108864

python -m uhd_gen generate \
    --graphs ./graphs --descriptor-tree ./descriptors \
    --engine vendor:gemm --engine-id <ENGINE-ID> \
    --role predict_engine --metric tflops time --arch gfx942 \

```

Choose features from the description's published graph, device, and constraint
fields. L1 signatures cannot consume candidate metadata. A workspace bound must
be identical during collection and prediction when the model depends on it.
The example feature set demonstrates the workflow, not an accuracy recommendation.

Generation preserves supplied graph UUIDs and assigns reproducible IDs to ID-less
JSON inputs. It records the physical device ID, selector revision, commands,
constraints, warmup, timing statistics, and disjoint training/evaluation graph-device
identities. L1 evaluation reports calibration errors and cross-engine immediate
selection regret, in the model's metric and direction (keys such as
`signed_bias_tflops` / `signed_bias_time`); every compared model must predict the same
metric, and a corpus with only one measured engine cannot establish cross-engine
selection quality.

The cross-engine oracle is every valid measurement, scored or not. An engine whose model
declines a graph (an `INVALID`/`UNAVAILABLE` answer, or a value the metric cannot take) is
placed as the runtime places it — after every scored engine, in the static engine order
(`sortEngineIds`; engines it does not name are ordered by public ID, and
`HIPDNN_HEUR_FALLBACK_ENGINE_ORDER` is not applied) — so selection regret includes the loss
of a declined fastest engine. Calibration is over scored rows only, and
`prediction_coverage` reports how many rows and problems were scored, and how many picks
fell to static order.
UED role-map keys use the bare architecture (for example, `gfx942`); candidate
collection retains feature-suffixed architecture strings in `device_arch`.

The runtime lives in `hipdnn_plugin_sdk/heuristics/uhd/` and, like the descriptor expression
language it evaluates, exists only with `HIPDNN_ENABLE_KERNEL_INGESTOR`; an engine reaches it
through a binding that
lives in compiled code: a `predict_engine` UED role for a descriptor-backed
engine, or, for an engine that ships no UED, the UHD UUID its provider declares in its
own engine definition (RFC 0019 Open Question 7, RESOLVED). Authoring an L1 model for an
opaque engine therefore means publishing a UHD carrying one of the ids that engine
already declares — `AsmSdpaEngine::L1_MODEL_IDS` for ASM SDPA,
`MIOPEN_ENGINE_L1_MODELS` / `MIOPEN_ENGINE_DETERMINISTIC_L1_MODELS` in `MiopenContainer.cpp`
for MIOpen — into a descriptor root that provider reads. The document itself declares no
engine, role or arch; an id no engine declares is unreachable, and an engine whose
declared id resolves to nothing contributes no score and falls back to static ordering.
An opaque engine's UHD must not name a descriptor set in `trained_against` -- it has no UED,
KMD or UMD to be trained against, and one that names them is refused. It must instead record
`trained_against.selector_revision`: the exact selector-revision string the engine reports in
its prediction binding, which names the selection logic the measurements were taken under.
The binding's `provider_build` (the loaded plugin's name, version and API version) is a
diagnostic, never a compatibility key: measurements from two builds reporting one selector
revision are repeats of each other. A model recording a different revision, or none, is
refused -- the engine stays applicable and reports UNAVAILABLE naming both revisions.
Start a fresh consumer process after installing a model: a compiled model is cached
for the lifetime of the engine that owns it.

Install the intended catalog-ranking model before collecting L1 measurements.
Changing that model changes the descriptor engine's immediate selector and can
invalidate an existing L1 model. Collect and train L1 against the final selector;
do not reuse labels from the previous ranking policy.

### Prediction queries and engine-selection policies

Predictions are a generation-tool surface, not a consumer API: there is no `Graph`
method for them (RFC 0019 Open Question 12, RFC 0017 §2). `hipdnn_bench` publishes
them for a finalized graph, and a C++ tool can read the same descriptor attributes
through `hipdnn_frontend::detail::getEnginePrediction()`:

```bash
# L1 (engine kind), described without evaluating a model:
hipdnn_bench --graph graph.json --engine-name <engine> --describe-engine-prediction
# L1 evaluated:
hipdnn_bench --graph graph.json --engine-name <engine> --predict-engine
# L2 (configuration kind): add the knob constraints that name the configuration.
hipdnn_bench --graph graph.json --engine-name <engine> --predict-engine --knob tile=128
```

Under the hood the engine descriptor answers the engine-kind query
(`HIPDNN_ATTR_ENGINE_PREDICTION_EXT`) and an engine config descriptor answers the
configuration-kind query (`HIPDNN_ATTR_ENGINECFG_PREDICTION_EXT`); the descriptor
queried states the kind, and the `*_PREDICTION_EVALUATE_EXT` input selects describe
(0) versus evaluate (1). Consumers still select engines the ordinary way:

```python
error = graph.create_execution_plans([hipdnn.HeuristicMode.B,
                                      hipdnn.HeuristicMode.FALLBACK])
```

- The quick policy (**Mode A**) ranks applicable engines by their L1 prediction in the
  request's ranking metric, without querying L2 or materializing losing engines'
  configuration catalogs. The chosen engine picks its kernel at plan build with its
  ranker for that metric, tuning disabled.
- The thorough policy (**Mode B**) uses an engine's calibrated L2 configuration
  prediction in that metric when available, otherwise its L1 prediction. The L2 result
  owns an `EngineVariant` containing the engine ID and explicit knob settings. Plan
  construction preserves those settings to execute the scored configuration.
- Engines without a usable prediction in the metric remain eligible after scored
  engines. If no engine has a usable score, the prediction policy declines rather than
  fabricating a ranking. An explicitly supplied fallback mode can then run.

`AVAILABLE` carries a `value` in the requested `metric`'s units (TFLOPS for `tflops`,
milliseconds for `time`); an engine never answers in another metric. `UNAVAILABLE` and
`INVALID` do not remove engine applicability. Description queries do not evaluate a model; evaluated
queries can omit binding/features metadata to keep the policy path lightweight.
Neither prediction kind times GPU work; L2 may prepare a candidate to ensure the
returned selection is executable.

A configuration-kind query scores the configuration its knob constraints name, so
replaying an `AVAILABLE` result is replaying those same knobs:

```python
knobs = [hipdnn.KnobSetting("tile", 128)]
error = graph.create_execution_plan_ext(engine_id, knobs)
```

Check the returned error, then call `build_plans()` before execution.
Preserving a configuration does not confer compiled-plan serialization support.
Graph serialization embeds a built plan only when the engine advertises that
capability; otherwise it stores the graph alone. For an engine without that
capability, restore the graph and explicitly reapply the owned configuration.

L2 cross-engine comparison requires a model trained against the metric's own label with
`--metric <m> --calibrated --timing-statistic avgTimeMs`. `generate` produces exactly
that for every requested metric it can label, and for the default run on an engine that
publishes no `graph.flops` says in a warning that the model it produced ranks a catalog
without being a calibrated L2 estimate. Do not relabel a latency or arbitrary-score model
as TFLOPS.

## Growing a training set

Measuring and training are separate steps, so measurements outlive the model they were
taken for and a later model can train on all of them:

```bash
# Measure a corpus once; the collection is the measurements plus everything training reads.
python -m uhd_gen generate --collect-only --graphs corpus/sdpa_fwd/graphs \
    --descriptor-tree tree --engine-id 4714091817493728420 --role predict_engine --output-dir col_1

# Or across N GPUs: --shard K/N measures every N-th graph, one collection per shard.
python -m uhd_gen generate --collect-only --shard 0/4 --graphs corpus/sdpa_fwd/graphs ... --output-dir col_1_s0

# Convert collections into a stored dataset (Parquet; appends, and skips a collection already
# added), then train on it.
python -m uhd_gen.dataset add --into store/sdpa_fwd --collection col_1 col_2 col_3
python -m uhd_gen generate --dataset store/sdpa_fwd --descriptor-tree tree ... --output-dir model
```

A dataset is `dataset.parquet` plus `dataset_manifest.json`, one entry per contribution
(collection, one-shot `generate` folder via `--generation`, or §8.3 CSVs via `--csv` with the
binding stated). Every contribution must share one engine binding. `generate --contribution
ID...` trains on a subset; `python -m uhd_gen.dataset export` writes contributions' rows back
out as JSON. A dataset of §8.3 CSVs alone trains as `train` would (`--target`, `--objective`,
`--group-by-feature`, `--no-promote`).

Training takes **one measurement of each configuration on each shape**: the newest session's
(a session is one collection on one device). The same shape measured on two GPUs of an arch is
one problem, not two. Kept twice, it would be weighted twice, and the held-out split, which is
keyed on (graph, device), would score the model on a shape it trained on. For a catalog sweep,
distinct kernel configurations on one shape are distinct rows. A repeat taken under another
engine binding is refused rather than superseded. `superseded_rows` in the generation manifest
counts what training set aside.

A collected row carries its regime (`regime`, `regime.<facet>`, `regime.operation`) from the
`manifest.csv` `hipdnn_corpus_gen` wrote beside the graphs. These are envelope columns, never
features.

### `size`: how many more shapes, and from which regimes

```bash
python -m uhd_gen size --dataset store/sdpa_fwd \
    --test-set store/test_set.json --create-test-set --target 0.70 --tolerance 0.10 \
    --descriptor-tree tree --engine-id 4714091817493728420 --arch gfx950 --uhd-id <id> \
    --output-dir sizing_1
```

1. **A pinned test set.** It is stratified by regime and created once. It is reused every
   round, so rounds are comparable, and never replaced.
2. **A learning curve.** `generate --dataset` trains on nested subsets of the other shapes
   (`--draws` random subsets per size), and `evaluate` scores each model on the test set.
3. **A measured ceiling.** A repeat measurement (another collection or GPU) disagrees with the
   label by two measurement errors, where a perfect model faces only one. The ceiling is how
   often the disagreement over sqrt(2) is within the tolerance. When no shape was measured
   twice, the ceiling is reported as unknown. When the curve already exceeds it, it is marked
   as not binding and the fit estimates its own floor.
4. **A fit.** miss(n) = floor + a·n^-b, with an interval from resampling the draws, solved for
   `--target`. A target at or past the ceiling is refused, because better measurement reaches
   it and more shapes cannot. Without a target, the plan is the next doubling.
5. **Regime quotas.** Every regime is first brought to `--floor` training shapes (30). The rest
   is split in proportion to each regime's test misses, shrunk toward the global rate for thin
   regimes, and scaled up by the rate of usable rows.

`sizing_report.json` (`uhd_gen.sizing/1`) holds the curve, the ceiling, the fit, the per-regime
table, the recommendation and the prediction. `--previous` checks the last round's prediction
against this round's result. `regime_quotas.json` is the input `hipdnn_corpus_gen` takes:

```bash
hipdnn_corpus_gen ... --regime-quotas sizing_1/regime_quotas.json \
    --exclude-corpus corpus_1/sdpa_fwd/manifest.json --seed <new>
```

With quotas, corpus_gen fills each named regime first. A regime its first pass under-fills is
searched again with the regime's declared equalities pinned (`seqlen_q == 1`) or tied
(`heads_kv == heads`), so a walk can reach populations it would otherwise almost never meet.
Every point still passes the engine, the constraints, `--keep` and `--exclude-corpus`.
`manifest.json` `reports.regime_quota` records asked, delivered and saturated per regime, and
the tool exits 3 when a quota is short without being shown saturated.

L1 (`predict_engine`) models only: within-X% is a per-row error, which is what an L1 predicts.

## Output

`train` generates:

```
output_dir/
├── <stem>.uhd.json     # the UHD: features, objective, score metric, artifact
├── model.bin           # FlatBuffer GbdtModel for TreeDataAdapter
└── train_manifest.json # training provenance
```

`<stem>` comes from `--descriptor-name` (default `heuristic`).

`DescriptorLoader` globs `<stem>.uhd.json` and reads `tree_data.artifact` as a
path relative to that file, so the directory relocates as a unit.

For a descriptor-backed engine, the UED names the heuristic by id. `train` prints
the id and records it in `train_manifest.json`; `promote` updates the UED and
isolates model files by engine, role, architecture and metric:

```
descriptor_tree/
├── <engine>.ued.json   # <role>.<arch> lists the UHDs, one per metric
└── heuristics/
    └── <engine-uuid>/
        └── <role>/
            └── <arch>/
                ├── <stem>.uhd.json      # a metric-less ranker, if any
                ├── model.bin
                └── <metric>/
                    ├── <stem>.uhd.json
                    └── model.bin
```

L1 and L2, and each metric's model, may all use the default source filenames without
overwriting each other: `<role>` and `<metric>` keep them in separate directories, and
each is referenced from its own entry in the UED role map.

### The artifact is content-addressed, and reproducible

`train` writes `tree_data.hash` — the SHA-256 of `model.bin`, bare hex, which is the form
`TreeDataAdapter` recomputes before parsing and refuses on mismatch (RFC 0019 §7.2). That
answers the question `features_hash` does not: `features_hash` fingerprints the *input
contract*, so two models over one signature and different training hash identically.
`train_manifest.json` records both halves RFC 0019.13 §10.5 asks for, `model_sha256` and
`uhd_sha256` over the emitted descriptor document.

`evaluate` runs the loader's checks before scoring (`uhd_gen/artifact.py`): declared
`tree_data.hash`, the `HGBM` file identifier, and the structural checks
`TreeDataAdapter::prepareTrees` applies, so a file the engine would refuse — and silently
replace with static order — is an error here rather than a regret figure. A grouped
artifact chooses its group in the objective's direction (the smallest layer-1 score under
`min`), as the runtime does.

A content hash is only worth recording if the bytes can be rebuilt, so conversion is
deterministic: converting one `.lgbm` twice produces identical files. Nothing stamps the
wall clock into the buffer. `training_date` is taken from an explicit argument, or from
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` when the environment sets one, and is otherwise **omitted** rather
than invented — an absent optional field costs a reader nothing, while a `datetime.now()`
costs them the ability to check a shipped artifact against its source. A
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` that is not an integer count of seconds is an error, not a silently
dropped stamp.

```bash
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --format=%ct) python -m uhd_gen train ...
sha256sum model.bin   # equals tree_data.hash, and equals it again on the next conversion
```

## Generated FlatBuffers bindings

`model.bin` is written through flatc-generated Python bindings that
live in `_generated/`, committed alongside the tool the same way the C++
`*_generated.h` headers are committed alongside the SDK.

```
_generated/hipdnn_flatbuffers_sdk/data_objects/
└── GbdtModel.py, GbdtTree.py                                        # gbdt_model.fbs
```

`uhd_gen/__init__.py` prepends that directory to `sys.path`, so `import
hipdnn_flatbuffers_sdk.data_objects.GbdtModel` resolves to the bindings that
match the schema shipping beside this tool rather than to any other copy
installed on the system.

Regenerate after editing the schema — a build with `HIPDNN_GENERATE_SDK_HEADERS=ON`
does it automatically, and so does the `flatc-hipdnn` pre-commit hook:

```bash
python projects/hipdnn/scripts/run_flatc.py \
    projects/hipdnn/flatbuffers_sdk/schemas/gbdt_model.fbs
```

That command emits both the C++ header and these bindings from one invocation, so
the two cannot drift. Requires flatc 25.9.23 on PATH (see
`projects/hipdnn/CONTRIBUTING.md`).

**Do not hand-write FlatBuffers vtables here.** A hand-written vtable whose slot count
disagrees with the schema shifts every later field one slot, so every artifact fails
verification, and a test asserting only the four-byte file identifier still passes: the
identifier sits before the root table and survives any vtable error. The descriptor is
JSON; `model.bin` is the only FlatBuffer this tool writes, and it goes through
generated bindings.

### `<stem>.uhd.json`

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "id": "...",
  "name": "GEMM UHD",
  "adapter": "tree_data",
  "features_signature": ["$q.M", "$q.N", "$q.K", "$kernel.tile_m", ...],
  "features_hash": "sha256:...",
  "objective": "max",
  "score": {"metric": "tflops", "calibrated": false, "transform": "log1p"},
  "categorical_encoding": {"$kernel.dtype": {"bf16": 0, "fp16": 1}},
  "tree_data": {"artifact": "model.bin"}
}
```

`score.metric` is the registered ranking metric the score estimates (`tflops` or `time`,
RFC 0019 §4.4), and `objective` is always that metric's direction. A metric-less
ranker omits `metric`, and cannot declare `calibrated: true`.

`categorical_encoding` maps each string-valued feature to the codes the model was
fitted with. It is derived from the training corpus, keyed by the full `$reference`
from `features_signature` (never the trailing field name — `kernel.dtype` and
`q.attention_dense.dtype` are two vocabularies, not one), and holds the values exactly
as the corpus spells them; codes run from 0 in sorted order. It is written only when
the corpus has a string column, and it is folded into `features_hash`, so changing the
map is a contract change even though the signature text is unchanged. The same dict is
recorded in `train_manifest.json` (as `{}` when there is none) and is the one
`evaluate` scores through, so evaluation encodes exactly as the fit did.

## Training Details

- **Target transform**: `log1p(target)` for scale-invariant training
- **Cross-validation**: GroupKFold when `--group-by` specified
- **Early stopping**: Prevents overfitting
- **Model format**: LightGBM → FlatBuffer GbdtModel

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Integration

The output files are loaded by hipDNN's UHD system:

`DescriptorLoader` parses `<stem>.uhd.json` while walking a descriptor tree, and
`makeKernelHeuristic` builds the scorer from it: `TreeDataAdapter` loads
`tree_data.artifact` relative to the descriptor, and `FeatureExtractor`
recomputes `features_hash` from `features_signature` and refuses the pair if the
two disagree.
