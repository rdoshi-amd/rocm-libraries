// Runtime dispatch seam for the MIOpen public wrapper. The stubs in
// src/private/wrapper.cpp use it to decide whether a public call goes to the
// MIOpen implementation (the _impl symbols in libMIOpen_private.so) or is
// forwarded to hipDNN. A call is forwarded only when MIOPEN_HIPDNN_FORWARDING
// enables forwarding AND the entry point is in the compile-time forwarding set.
//
// ParseForwardingMode/IsInForwardingSet/ResolveRoute take every input
// explicitly (even the diagnostics stream) so tests can exercise both routes
// without touching the environment. GetForwardingMode() and Dispatch() hold the
// process-global state.
