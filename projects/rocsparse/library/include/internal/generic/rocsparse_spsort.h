/*! \ingroup generic_module
*  \brief Sparse matrix sorting.
*
*  \details
*  \p rocsparse_spsort sorts the source sparse matrix and writes the result to the target sparse
*  matrix. The target matrix must be created with the same format, dimensions, number of
*  non-zeros, index types, data type and index base as the source matrix. If the same descriptor
*  is passed for \p source and \p target, the matrix is sorted in place. Otherwise, the arrays of
*  the target matrix must not overlap the arrays of the source matrix.
*
*  The supported formats are \ref rocsparse_format_coo, \ref rocsparse_format_csr and
*  \ref rocsparse_format_csc :
*  - COO: the \ref rocsparse_direction set with \ref rocsparse_spsort_input_direction selects
*    the sort order. \ref rocsparse_direction_row sorts the entries by row and then by column,
*    and \ref rocsparse_direction_column sorts them by column and then by row.
*  - CSR: the column indices within each row are sorted. The row pointer of the target matrix
*    is a copy of the row pointer of the source matrix.
*  - CSC: the row indices within each column are sorted. The column pointer of the target
*    matrix is a copy of the column pointer of the source matrix.
*
*  The direction is only used by the COO format. It does not need to be set for the CSR and
*  CSC formats, and is ignored if it is.
*
*  Uniform strided batched matrices are supported. They are set up with
*  \ref rocsparse_coo_set_strided_batch, \ref rocsparse_csr_set_strided_batch or
*  \ref rocsparse_csc_set_strided_batch. Every sample of the batch must have the same sparsity
*  pattern, with the same offsets and indices in the same order, and only the values may differ.
*  The indices are sorted once, and the resulting permutation is applied to the values of every
*  sample.
*
*  The batch count is given by the target matrix. The source matrix must either have the same
*  batch count, or a batch count of one and a batch stride of zero, in which case every sample of
*  the target matrix is the sorted source matrix. The batch stride must be at least the number of
*  non-zeros. For the CSR and CSC formats, the offsets batch stride must be either zero, when all
*  samples share one offsets array, or at least the size of the offsets array.
*
*  \note
*  The \ref rocsparse_spsort_stage_compute stage is non-blocking and executed asynchronously with
*  respect to the host for the CSR and CSC formats. For the COO format, it is blocking with respect
*  to the host.
*
*  \note
*  This routine does not support execution in a hipGraph context.
