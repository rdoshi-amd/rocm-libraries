# rocThrust CCCL-sync skills

This directory (`ai/skills/rocthrust-cccl-sync*`) is the canonical, live copy
of the skill family that ports upstream NVIDIA CCCL/Thrust commits into
rocThrust (`projects/rocthrust/` in `ROCm/rocm-libraries`). Use this copy —
not any other checkout of these skills — for both running them and editing
them.

## Prerequisites for a new session

- A local clone of `ROCm/rocm-libraries` with a `cccl` remote pointing at
  `https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl.git` (the skills add this remote
  themselves if it's missing).
- Know the path to that clone. Every skill asks for it up front and stores
  it as `$ROCTHRUST_REPO` — have it ready, or be ready to answer when asked.
  Nothing here guesses a path.

## The four skills, in pipeline order

1. **`rocthrust-cccl-sync-investigate`** — Step 0. Read-only. Works out
   which CCCL version rocThrust currently tracks (via `THRUST_VERSION` plus
   three weaker corroborating signals), confirms a target tag with you, then
   catalogs new features, new CMake options/macros, test/benchmark coverage
   gaps, and commits likely to be risky for rocThrust. Produces
   `cccl-investigation-<tag>.md` at the repo root.
2. **`rocthrust-cccl-sync-todo`** — the driver. Creates the sync branch and
   writes `todo.md` at the repo root: the ordered, checkbox list of every
   upstream commit that needs porting. Does not port any code itself.
3. **`rocthrust-cccl-sync-resolve`** — the workhorse. Works through
   `todo.md` one commit at a time, **strictly in order** (never skip ahead
   or batch), porting each commit's Thrust changes by hand, ticking it off
   and committing it as one local commit per item (never pushed).
4. **`rocthrust-cccl-sync-finalize`** — run once every `todo.md` item is
   ticked. A read-only audit: completeness/lint, file renames, counterpart
   sweep, CMake wiring and `examples/` copyright headers. It reports
   findings and changes nothing — no CHANGELOG, no version bump, no commit.

## Starting a new session

Just describe what you want in plain language — each `SKILL.md` declares
its own trigger phrasing. For example:

- *"What changed in the next CCCL release we haven't synced yet?"* →
  `rocthrust-cccl-sync-investigate`
- *"Kick off a CCCL sync into rocThrust."* → `rocthrust-cccl-sync-todo`
- *"Continue the sync"* / *"work the next todo.md item"* →
  `rocthrust-cccl-sync-resolve`
- *"Everything in todo.md is ticked, audit the sync."* →
  `rocthrust-cccl-sync-finalize`

There's no need to name a skill explicitly or read `SKILL.md` yourself
first — reference it by describing the task, and it will be picked up from
this directory.

## Key conventions to know before you start

- **No git merge, ever.** rocThrust has no subtree-merge mechanism. There
  is never a `MERGE_HEAD`, never conflict markers. Every upstream commit is
  hand-ported and committed locally as its own commit
  (`feat(rocthrust): port CCCL <sha11> - <subject>`, empty for N/A items),
  so the sync branch maps 1:1 onto `todo.md`. Nothing is pushed by the
  skills.
- **`todo.md` order is strict.** Only the first unticked item may be worked
  next — later commits may assume earlier ones already landed.
- **All of upstream `thrust/`.** Every skill scopes to the whole upstream
  `thrust/` subtree, so no Thrust commit is missed; commits that don't
  apply (CMake, README) are listed and ticked N/A. `thrust/<path>`
  translates to `projects/rocthrust/<path>`, except `thrust/benchmarks/` →
  `projects/rocthrust/benchmark/` (singular).
- **Test and benchmark parity.** rocThrust keeps `testing/`, `test/` and
  `benchmark/` at parity with upstream. Upstream Catch2 tests are
  implemented with Google Test; benchmarks use Google Benchmark.
- **Two AMD-only counterpart trees have no upstream commit trail of their
  own**: `thrust/system/hip/` (CUDA's HIP counterpart) and
  `projects/rocthrust/test/` (a hand-maintained GTest suite mirroring
  `testing/`, naming convention `testing/<name>.cu` →
  `test/test_<name>.cpp`). `rocthrust-cccl-sync-resolve` checks both for
  every commit and requires the disposition to be recorded in the
  `todo.md` tick-note, even when the answer is "no change needed" —
  `rocthrust-todo-lint.sh` (see `rocthrust-cccl-sync-resolve/scripts/`)
  mechanically enforces this, and `-finalize`'s audit reports any violation
  as blocking.
- **`todo.md` and any investigation/report `.md` files are scratch state**,
  never committed — safe to discard once a sync lands, or attach to a
  tracking ticket.

particular phase.
