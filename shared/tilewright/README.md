# tilewright

tilewright is a small CPU library that ranks candidate GEMM kernels for a
problem with a trained model. A caller hands it a GEMM problem, the device's
properties and its pool of candidate kernels; tilewright filters the pool,
scores the survivors with the model trained for the problem's region of the
problem space, and returns the pool best-first.

hipBLASLt's TensileLite uses it, when `TENSILE_USE_TILEWRIGHT` is set, to order
the kernels of a library's Prediction rows, falling back to its analytical
(Origami) ranking when tilewright has no model for the library or scores none
of its kernels. tilewright itself
depends on no GEMM framework: it does not include Tensile, TensileLite or
Origami headers, and callers convert their own types into tilewright's.

The models are produced by the training pipeline in
[`training_pipeline/`](training_pipeline/README.md).

## How a problem is ranked

**Execution context.** A ranking describes where the kernels will run: the CUs
they may use and the tile scheduling (`ExecutionContext {cu_budget, schedule}`;
the default is exclusive use of the device with the default schedule). A model
scores only the contexts it was trained for (`supports(model, context,
hardware)`). The shipped models were trained with every CU of the device and
the default schedule: a `cu_budget` below the device's CU count, or a dynamic or
automatic schedule, leaves every kernel unscored, and TensileLite then uses its
Origami ranking, which models those cases.

**Routing.** A problem maps to one of 96 base cells
`<M tier>|<N tier>|<K tier>|<batch tier>`: M and N are `Tiny` (≤ 32), `Small`
(≤ 128), `Mid` (≤ 512) or `Large`; K is `TinyK` (≤ 32), `MidK` (≤ 512) or
`LargeK`; batch is `Bnone` (batch == 1) or `Bany`. A model's split tree refines
a base cell along one axis at a time (`M`, `N`, `K` or `B`; values at or below
the threshold go to the `lo` child), giving labels such as
`Large|Large|LargeK|Bnone#N<=10092`. The problem is scored by the leaf's cell,
or by its nearest trained ancestor (the label with trailing `#...` segments
removed) when the leaf has no trained cell. With no trained cell at all, every
kernel is returned unscored.

**Filtering.** Each kernel of the pool then passes, in order:

1. an LDS-capacity gate: `mt_m*mt_k*bytes(A) + mt_n*mt_k*bytes(B)` must fit in
   the device's LDS;
2. a feasibility filter: a small batched problem (M, N ≤ 256, K < 1024,
   batch ≠ 1) must fit in one macro tile; Dot2 kernels (MI 1x1x64) only serve
   M < 3; and hinted kernels (`cache_hints != 0`) are only used when K and the
   kernel's `mt_k` are both 128-byte aligned in A's element size, where a skinny
   problem requires the non-temporal variant of its large operand
   (`cache_hints == 4`) when the pool contains such a variant for that operand,
   while every other problem rejects hinted kernels;
3. the cell's whitelist of kernel signatures
   `(mt_m, mt_n, mt_k, mi_m, mi_n, mi_k, cache_hints_a, cache_hints_b)`.

The feasible whitelisted kernels form tier 1. If the whitelist rejects every
feasible kernel, all feasible kernels form tier 1. When the caller asks for
more results than tier 1 holds (`min_scored`), the other feasible kernels are
scored as tier 2.

**Scoring.** Each cell is a two-tower model. Features are computed in double
precision and rounded once to float, as in the training pipeline, and are
whitened with the cell's means and standard deviations, `(x - mean) / std` (a
standard deviation below 1e-6 counts as 1):

- query features (55) describe the problem and the device;
- item features (12) describe the kernel;
- interaction features (37) describe the problem and kernel together, including
  the matrix-instruction latency, which uses the MI-latency table, the
  `parallel_mi_cu` and bandwidth constants stored in the model.

An item feature whose stored standard deviation is below 1e-3 is treated as
constant: in training it took a single value, which lies within rounding noise
of the stored mean. A value within two standard deviations of the mean,
`|x - mean| <= 2 * std` in float, whitens as above; any other value whitens to
0, the value at the training mean, rather than to a huge multiple of a tiny
deviation (for example an occupancy the cell never saw). Query and interaction
features always use the plain whitening. The training pipeline whitens its
features with the same rule.

```
score = dot(query_mlp(q), item_mlp(i)) / max(|temperature|, 0.1) + interaction_mlp(x)
```

Higher is better. A model file names the feature catalog it was trained on by a
hash, and the loader selects that catalog; this engine has one catalog,
`e7fe4b524851e895` (`feature_catalog_hash()`), and rejects other hashes.

**Kernels that score alike.** The catalog reads twelve numeric `Config` fields,
the kernel's view key: `mt` and `mi` (m, n, k each), `occupancy`,
`cache_hints_a`, `cache_hints_b`, `grvw_a`, `grvw_b` and `gwvw_d`. Kernels with
equal view keys get identical features, feasibility, whitelist membership and
scores, so a pool is grouped by view key and each group is filtered and scored
once; a `CandidateSet` caches item embeddings per group. The result still has
one entry per kernel, exactly as if every kernel were scored on its own.
`index` and `attributes` (named integer kernel properties, see the API) are not
part of the shipped catalog and never change a ranking.

**Result.** `rank` returns one `Result {config_index, score, scored}` per
input kernel (`config_index` is the kernel's position in the pool): tier 1
best-first, then tier 2 best-first, then the unscored kernels in input order.
Equal scores keep input order (`TieBreak::PoolOrder`, the default). With
`TieBreak::Prior` and a caller-supplied prior (one value per kernel), equal
scores are ordered by ascending prior, non-finite priors last, then input order;
the prior never moves a kernel past one with a different score or into another
tier. A kernel whose score is not finite is unscored, and invalid hardware
(`N_CU`, `lds_capacity` or `L2_capacity` equal to 0) leaves every kernel
unscored.

**Numerics.** Scoring is fp32. Every inner product uses one fixed summation
order: 16 interleaved lanes accumulated with fused multiply-adds, a fixed
pairwise reduction of the lanes, then the remaining elements added in order.
The scalar, AVX2 and AVX-512 kernels (chosen at run time from the CPU's
features) implement that order exactly, and the library is built without
fast-math or floating-point contraction, so rankings do not depend on the
instruction set the CPU offers or on the compiler (GCC or Clang). Features are
computed in double with the C library's `log2` and rounded once to float. Weights stay
packed in memory and a cell's weights are converted to fp32 on the first
ranking that reaches the cell.

## Model files (MLREC_v2)

A model file is little-endian:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| magic | `char[8]` | `MLREC_v2` |
| endian marker | `u32` | `0x01020304` |
| header_size | `u32` | bytes from offset 0 to the first payload byte |
| payload_size | `u64` | payload bytes (the trailer excluded) |
| payload_crc32 | `u32` | CRC-32/ISO-HDLC of the payload |
| weight_dtype | `u8` | 0 fp32, 1 bf16, 2 int8, 3 int4 |
| reserved | `u8[3]` | 0 |
| q_dim, i_dim, x_dim | `u32` each | 55, 12, 37 |
| n_cells, n_splits | `u32` each | |
| feature_catalog_hash | `u16` length + ASCII | must equal `feature_catalog_hash()` |
| arch | `u16` length + ASCII | for example `gfx950`, `gfx1250v0` |
| parallel_mi_cu | `f64` | > 0 |
| bw_c0, bw_c1, bw_c2 | `f64` each | `bw_occ = min(1, c0*a*a + c1*a + c2)`, `a = min(total tiles, N_CU)` |
| mi_default_cycles | `f64` | cycles for an MI shape missing from the table |
| n_mi | `u32` | at most 1024 |
| MI table | `n_mi` x {`u32` m, n, k; `i32` dtype; `f64` cycles} | dtype is a `tilewright::DataType` value |

The payload follows: `n_splits` split records
(`u16`+parent label, axis char and NUL, `i32` threshold, `u16`+lo label,
`u16`+hi label), then `n_cells` cell records (`u16`+label, `u32` embed, hidden
and interaction widths, `f32` temperature, the six whitening vectors, `u32`
signature count and `i32[8]` signatures, then the weight matrices and biases of
the three towers). Matrices use `weight_dtype` (bf16: `bits << 16`; int8: `f32`
scale then `i8` values; int4: `f32` scale then two values per byte, low nibble
first, value = scale * (nibble - 8)); biases, whitening vectors and
temperatures are always fp32. The file ends with `MLRECEND`, and its size is
exactly `header_size + payload_size + 8`.

The MI table is looked up by `(mi_m, mi_n, mi_k, dtype)` with the fnuz FP8
types mapped to their non-fnuz counterparts; the latency feature is
`cycles / max(parallel_mi_cu, 1)`.

The loader validates everything before using it: sizes and counts against the
bytes that remain, the CRC, the feature dims and hash, finite floating-point
values, split axes, labels (non-empty printable ASCII without spaces), duplicate cell labels
and split parents, an acyclic split tree, the MI table, and the trailer. MLREC_v1
files are rejected; convert them with
`training_pipeline/scripts/convert_mlrec_v1_to_v2.py`. The training pipeline
writes MLREC_v2 with `training_pipeline/lib/mlrec.py`.

## C++ API

```cpp
#include "tilewright/model.hpp"

std::string error;
tilewright::ModelPtr model = tilewright::load_model(path, &error);  // nullptr + error on failure
if (!model) { /* report error */ }

std::vector<tilewright::Config> pool = ...;               // the caller's kernels
tilewright::CandidateSet candidates(model, std::move(pool));  // reuse for every problem

tilewright::Hardware hw{n_cu, lds_bytes, l2_bytes};       // queried from the device
std::vector<tilewright::Result> ranked = candidates.rank(problem, hw, /*min_scored=*/0);

// A call that runs with a CU budget or another tile schedule.
tilewright::ExecutionContext context{cu_budget, tilewright::Schedule::Dynamic};
if (!tilewright::supports(*model, context, hw)) { /* use another ranking */ }
```

- `load_model(path)`, `load_model_from_memory(data, size)` and
  `load_model_by_index(logic_stem, dir)` never throw; they return `nullptr` and
  set the error message on failure. `load_model` returns the already loaded
  model for a path that resolves to the same file. `load_model_by_index` reads
  `<dir>/tilewright_index` and returns `nullptr` with an empty error when the
  index or the stem is absent.
- `Config` holds the kernel's numeric parameters, the caller's `index` (not
  interpreted) and `attributes`: further named `int64` properties
  (`Attribute {name, value}`) in any order, with non-empty, unique names. A
  feature catalog reads the attributes it knows; the shipped catalog reads none.
- `CandidateSet(model, configs, PoolOptions{tie_break})` holds a fixed pool and
  throws `std::invalid_argument` for a null model or a config with an empty or
  duplicate attribute name. The item embeddings and whitelist membership of its
  kernels are computed the first time a problem reaches a cell and reused
  afterwards; it is safe to share between threads.
  `rank(problem, hardware, min_scored)` ranks for exclusive use of the device;
  `rank(problem, hardware, context, min_scored, prior)` ranks for `context`
  (every kernel unscored unless `supports(model, context, hardware)`) and, with
  `TieBreak::Prior`, orders equal scores by `prior` (a vector with one value per
  kernel, or null; another size throws `std::invalid_argument`).
- `rank_configs(model, problem, hardware, configs, min_scored)` and
  `rank_configs(model, problem, hardware, context, configs, min_scored,
  tie_break, prior)` return the same results as a `CandidateSet` for an ad-hoc
  list, without caching, and validate attributes the same way.
- `attribute_names(model)` lists the Config attributes the model's feature
  catalog reads (none for v2 models), so a caller can attach only those.
- `route(model, problem)` and `cell_label(model, cell)` expose routing;
  `describe(model)` returns the arch, hash, weight type and sizes;
  `compute_features(model, problem, config, hardware)` returns the raw
  (unwhitened) feature vectors.

`DataType` values are part of the model format (MI-table keys). They follow
Origami's enumeration, which has an `Int4` entry that Tensile's does not, so
convert Tensile data types by name rather than by value.

## Python

```bash
pip install shared/tilewright/python
```

```python
import tilewright as tw

model = tw.load_model("weights/hipblaslt/gfx950/gfx950/<name>.tilewright.bin")
pool = tw.CandidateSet(model, [tw.Config(mt=tw.Dim3(256, 256, 64), mi=tw.Dim3(16, 16, 32), occupancy=1)])
problem = tw.Problem(size=tw.Dim3(4096, 4096, 4096), a_transpose=tw.Transpose.T,
                     a_dtype=tw.DataType.BFloat16, b_dtype=tw.DataType.BFloat16,
                     c_dtype=tw.DataType.BFloat16, d_dtype=tw.DataType.BFloat16,
                     mi_dtype=tw.DataType.BFloat16)
ranked = pool.rank(problem, tw.Hardware(N_CU=64, lds_capacity=65536, L2_capacity=4 << 20))
```

The module mirrors the C++ API. Enumerations are integer enums (`DataType.None`
is spelled `DataType.None_`), structures accept keyword arguments, and the GIL
is released while models load and pools rank. `Config.attributes` is a
`dict[str, int]`; `CandidateSet(model, configs, tie_break=TieBreak.PoolOrder)`,
`CandidateSet.rank(problem, hardware, min_scored=0, context=None, prior=None)`
and `rank_configs(model, problem, hardware, configs, min_scored=0, context=None,
tie_break=TieBreak.PoolOrder, prior=None)` take the context and tie-break
arguments of the C++ API (`context=None` is exclusive use),
`supports(model, context, hardware)` reports whether a model scores a context,
and `attribute_names(model)` lists the attributes it reads.
`load_model` and `load_model_from_memory` raise `ValueError` with the loader's
message when the data is not a valid model, and invalid attribute names or a
prior of the wrong length raise `ValueError`; `load_model_by_index` returns
`None` when the index or stem is absent.

## Environment variables

Read once per process. For `TILEWRIGHT_DIAG` and `TILEWRIGHT_PICK_LOG`, a value
of `0` or an empty value counts as unset.

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `TILEWRIGHT_DIAG` | One stderr line per loaded model: `[TILEWRIGHT_DIAG FILE] path=... arch=... qhash=... qdim=55 idim=12 xdim=37 n_cells=N n_splits=N weights=int4`, and `[TILEWRIGHT_DIAG FAIL] <reason>` for a load that fails |
| `TILEWRIGHT_PICK_LOG` | One stderr line per ranking that scores a kernel: `[TILEWRIGHT_PICK] m=.. n=.. k=.. b=.. tA=.. tB=.. leaf=<label> top1_sig=(mt_m=..,mt_n=..,mt_k=..,mi_m=..,mi_n=..,mi_k=..,cha=..,chb=..) top1_score=.. top1_index=.. n_configs=..`; `top1_index` is the pool position of the top-ranked kernel |
| `TILEWRIGHT_FORCE_CELL` | Score every problem with this cell index, for debugging; ignored when it is not a valid index of the model |

tilewright writes nothing else to stderr. Whether hipBLASLt uses tilewright at
all is controlled by hipBLASLt (`TENSILE_USE_TILEWRIGHT`).

## Weights

Shipped models live in `weights/hipblaslt/<arch>/<arch>/`, mirroring the
Tensile library tree: one `.tilewright.bin` per trained library, named after the
logic file it was trained on (so a model shared by several trees keeps the name
of the tree it was trained for), plus a `tilewright_index` that maps Tensile
library stems to model files:

```
# comment
<TensileLibrary stem>	<model file>
```

The model files are ordinary binary files in the repository (marked `binary` in
`.gitattributes`), so any checkout that includes `shared/tilewright` has them.
hipBLASLt copies each tree's index and models next to its Tensile library
files; TensileLite finds them only for libraries loaded from per-logic files,
which is hipBLASLt's default layout (`HIPBLASLT_ENABLE_LAZY_LOAD=ON`).

## Building and testing

tilewright needs CMake 3.25.2 and a C++17 compiler. Standalone:

```bash
cd shared/tilewright
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

| Option | Default | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `TILEWRIGHT_BUILD_TESTING` | ON standalone, OFF as a subproject | Build the Catch2 suite (and the pytest suite with the bindings) |
| `TILEWRIGHT_ENABLE_PYTHON` | OFF | Build the Python module |
| `TILEWRIGHT_ENABLE_INSTALL` | ON standalone, OFF as a subproject | Install the library, headers and CMake package |
| `TILEWRIGHT_ENABLE_FETCH` | ON | Fetch Catch2 (and nanobind for CMake builds of the bindings) when they are not installed |

The tests use `find_package(Catch2 3)` and fetch Catch2 only when it is missing
and fetching is enabled. They write their own synthetic models; the real-model
tests additionally load every shipped model. The environment-variable tests run
as separate ctest entries because the knobs are read once per process.

As a subproject, `add_subdirectory(shared/tilewright)` provides the static
library `roc::tilewright`. An installed tilewright is found with
`find_package(tilewright)`, which provides the same target.
